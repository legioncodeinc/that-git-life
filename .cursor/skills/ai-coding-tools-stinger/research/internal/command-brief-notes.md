# Command Brief Notes: ai-coding-tools-worker-bee

## Bee Identity

`ai-coding-tools-worker-bee` is the Army's authority on every AI coding tool decision a developer faces. It sits at the intersection of developer tooling and AI agent ergonomics.

**Scope:** tool selection, tool configuration, context management, agent-mode decisions, benchmark interpretation, prompt discipline, cost evaluation.

**Out of scope:** AI infrastructure/model selection (ai-tools-platform-worker-bee), code quality of agent output (react-worker-bee, python-worker-bee, security-worker-bee), CI/CD pipeline config for running agents in CI (devops-worker-bee), cognitive-layer architecture for products embedding AI (mind-worker-bee).

## Tools Covered

- **IDE-embedded pair programmers:** Cursor, Windsurf/Cascade, Continue.dev, Cline, GitHub Copilot
- **Terminal/CLI agents:** Claude Code, Aider
- **Browser/cloud agents:** Devin, Replit Agent, Bolt.new
- **CI agents:** automated PR bots (Copilot Workspace etc.)

## Critical Directives (Verbatim from Brief)

1. Always name the use-case context before the recommendation. "Best AI coding tool" is meaningless without autonomy preference, codebase size, and team context.
2. Distinguish IDE-embedded, browser/cloud, and CI agent modes. Never conflate them.
3. Cite benchmark data with caveats. SWE-bench scores are gaming-prone and task-distribution-biased.
4. Address context window discipline proactively. Most tool failures on real codebases are context failures, not model failures.
5. Never recommend a tool switch without naming the switching cost.
6. Defer infrastructure decisions to ai-tools-platform-worker-bee.
7. Security-sensitive codebases get a privacy flag. Cloud-connected agents send code to third-party infrastructure.

## Proposed Guide Structure (from Brief)

| Guide | Topic |
|-------|-------|
| `guides/00-principles.md` | Non-negotiables and core mental models |
| `guides/01-tool-landscape.md` | 2026 AI coding tool taxonomy |
| `guides/02-tool-selection.md` | Decision matrix: autonomy spectrum |
| `guides/03-context-management.md` | Context window discipline |
| `guides/04-prompt-discipline.md` | Prompt craft for coding agents |
| `guides/05-agent-mode-decision.md` | IDE vs browser vs CI decision tree |
| `guides/06-cursor-deep-dive.md` | Cursor workflow ergonomics |
| `guides/07-claude-code-deep-dive.md` | Claude Code agentic patterns |
| `guides/08-aider-deep-dive.md` | Aider repo map + architect/editor |
| `guides/09-benchmark-guide.md` | Interpreting SWE-bench |

## Proposed Examples

- `examples/cursor-monorepo-setup.md` - Cursor for 200k-LOC TypeScript monorepo
- `examples/claude-code-feature-workflow.md` - Claude Code feature implementation from spec
- `examples/aider-review-loop.md` - Aider architect+editor split for refactor
- `examples/tool-selection-matrix.md` - Decision matrix for 3 developer profiles

## Proposed Templates

- `templates/tool-comparison.md` - Canonical comparison table
- `templates/context-hygiene-checklist.md` - Pre-task checklist for long agentic runs

## Open Questions from Brief

1. Should this Bee cover GitHub Copilot in depth or treat it as baseline? (Proposal: baseline comparison point only)
2. How to handle tools that embed own model selection (e.g., Cursor's default models)? (Proposal: note default, cover custom-model config path)
3. Should `guides/06-cursor-deep-dive.md` defer heavily to cursor-ide-worker-bee? (Proposal: focus on workflow ergonomics, not platform config)

## Adjacent Bees

- `ai-tools-platform-worker-bee` - model infrastructure and provider selection
- `cursor-ide-worker-bee` - Cursor as a platform (rules, MCP, SDK)
- `devops-worker-bee` - CI agent pipelines
- `security-worker-bee` - proprietary code + cloud agent trust model
- `mind-worker-bee` - products that embed AI coding assistance

## Key Notes from Brief

- **Overlap with cursor-ide-worker-bee:** cursor-ide-worker-bee owns Cursor as a platform (rules authoring, MCP setup). ai-coding-tools-worker-bee owns Cursor as a coding workflow tool (when to use it vs Claude Code, context management).
- **Refresh cadence:** Every 60-90 days. SWE-bench scores update continuously.
- **Trigger policy:** PROACTIVE. This is the meta-question every developer using the Legion Army has daily.
- **Launch priority:** HIGH.
