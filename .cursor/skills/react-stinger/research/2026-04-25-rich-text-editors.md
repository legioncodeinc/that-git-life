## Notes

Decision axes that came out of the doc and are reflected in the guide:
1. Notion-likeness vs blank-canvas customization
2. Collaborative vs solo
3. AI completions out of the box vs build-your-own
4. A11y floor (Lexical leads)
5. Mobile / RN story (Lexical leads)

No new web_search_exa expansions performed. The source URLs in the research doc are the canonical references and the guide cites them directly. Realtime collab infra (Yjs / Liveblocks / PartyKit) is handed off to `devops-worker-bee` rather than expanded here.
