# Help Scout Docs: Features, Limitations, and Platform Positioning (2026)

## Summary

Help Scout Docs is a lightweight knowledge base component bundled with the Help Scout customer support platform. It is tightly integrated with Help Scout's shared inbox and Beacon widget, making it an excellent choice for teams already using Help Scout for support. However, it lacks advanced KB features found in purpose-built platforms. The platform is best suited for small-to-medium teams who prioritize simplicity and Beacon widget integration over advanced authoring or analytics capabilities.

## Key Quotations / Statistics

- "Help Scout Docs is a lightweight knowledge base component of the Help Scout customer support platform" with WYSIWYG interface supporting text, images, lists, tables, and code blocks with auto-save and revision history
- "No version control on articles" - a critical gap for multi-version SaaS products
- "No auto-translation capabilities" - requires external tools for multi-language
- "No content reuse or snippets" - higher maintenance cost for repeated content
- "No multi-tenant portals (capped at 10 Docs sites maximum)"
- "No approval workflows or content governance"
- All Help Scout plans include at least one Docs site; additional sites cost $20 USD/site/month
- Free plan limited to 10 articles - "more of a demo than a functional knowledge base"
- Customers can rate articles for feedback (article ratings built-in)

## Annotations for weapon-forge

- This source directly informs `guides/01-platform-selection.md`: Help Scout Docs is the right recommendation ONLY for teams already using Help Scout Beacon who do not need versioning or advanced analytics
- The "no version control" gap is the primary trigger for the version-drift anti-pattern the Angel must flag
- The 10-article Free plan limit means teams evaluating Help Scout for KB must be on a paid plan
- The Beacon widget integration is the primary differentiation vs. other lightweight KB tools (Notion, Confluence)
- The $20/site/month add-on pricing matters for teams with multiple products or brands
