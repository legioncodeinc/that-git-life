## Cross-references

- `guides/13-ecosystem-catalog.md` does not cover uploads or trees — this guide is additive.
- Storage backend (S3 / R2 / GCS), signed URLs, lifecycle policies handed off to `devops-worker-bee`.
- Per-upload auth scoping handed off to `security-worker-bee`.
- Image transforms / CDN delivery (Cloudinary, Imgix, unpic) referenced from the source doc but out of scope here — flagged for `library-worker-bee` PRD if needed.

## Notes

The guide's central new contribution: the **chunked / resumable upload story**. tus + Uppy is the canonical pattern; "send the whole file in one POST" is broken for files >100 MB or flaky networks.

The a11y floor on uploads (keyboard-operable drop zone, `role="progressbar"`, focusable cancel, live-region errors) and on trees (arrow-key nav, type-ahead, virtualization) is codified in the guide because both are common regression sources.

No new web_search_exa expansions performed.
