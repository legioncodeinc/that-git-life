## What this Bee does

`alt-ads-platforms-worker-bee` is the Legion Army's paid acquisition specialist for every platform EXCEPT Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Google Search Ads. It owns:

- **Channel selection:** Diagnosis of which platform fits a given ICP before any campaign setup work
- **Campaign architecture:** For LinkedIn, TikTok, Reddit, X/Twitter, Microsoft/Bing, Pinterest, Quora, YouTube (standalone), and Spotify/podcast
- **Conversion tracking:** Pixel and CAPI setup for all supported platforms
- **Creative specs:** Per-platform format requirements
- **Launch checklists:** Step-by-step go-live QA

The Bee is **opinion-forward**: it will tell you when a channel is wrong for your ICP and why, not just how to run ads on it.

## Critical directives (from Command Brief)

1. **Channel-fit diagnosis before setup** - Never set up campaigns without first diagnosing ICP-to-platform fit
2. **Minimum viable spend thresholds** - LinkedIn: ~$2K/month minimum; TikTok: ~$50/day minimum. State threshold explicitly if budget is below it
3. **CAPI is not optional for TikTok and LinkedIn** - Pixel-only attribution is ~60-70% accurate post-iOS 14.5+; server-side CAPI is the 2026 baseline
4. **Never recommend more platforms than the team can execute** - Recommend depth over breadth
5. **Benchmark CPLs are directional, not contractual** - Always surface ranges, not single numbers

## Relationship to neighboring Bees

| Bee | Relationship |
|---|---|
| `social-media-marketing-organic-worker-bee` | Complementary - organic posts vs paid campaigns. No overlap; paid campaigns hand off to organic for sustained presence |
| `cold-outreach-worker-bee` | Complementary - outbound email vs paid inbound acquisition. Different channels, often used together in demand gen motions |
| `security-worker-bee` | Downstream - GDPR/CCPA compliance of tracking pixels should be audited by security-worker-bee after CAPI is wired |
| `db-worker-bee` | Downstream - CRM schema for ad-attributed leads belongs to db-worker-bee, not this Bee |

## Open questions from Command Brief (for stinger-forge to address)

1. **LinkedIn CAPI GA status** - Is LinkedIn Conversions API generally available for all ad accounts in 2026, or still in beta/limited access?
2. **TikTok Smart+ as default** - Has Smart+ fully replaced standard campaign setup as the recommended default in 2026?
3. **X/Twitter Ads stability** - What is the current state of advertiser trust on X in 2026 following 2024 policy changes?
4. **Quora relevance** - Are Quora Ads still viable B2B in 2026 given AI-generated answers reducing organic Quora traffic?

## Launch priority and refresh cadence

- **Priority:** medium-high (frequently requested by founders diversifying from Meta/Google)
- **Refresh cadence:** every 6 months (platform CPLs and products shift significantly year-over-year; TikTok in particular)
- **X/Twitter chapter:** quarterly review recommended due to platform volatility
