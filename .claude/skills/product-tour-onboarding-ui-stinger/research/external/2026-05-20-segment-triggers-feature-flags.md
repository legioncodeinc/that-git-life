# Segment-Based Tour Triggers and Feature-Flag Gating (2026)

## Summary

Practitioner synthesis drawn from userTourKit's LaunchDarkly integration blog post (May 2026), oneuptime.com's segment targeting guide (January 2026), and turn.io's segment-based trigger release (February 2026). Covers the three canonical trigger patterns for product tours in 2026: (1) segment-based triggers that evaluate user attributes (plan tier, role, lifecycle cohort) against a rule set at runtime, (2) feature-flag-gated triggers that use an existing flag evaluation (LaunchDarkly, PostHog, GrowthBook) as the gate condition, and (3) event-based triggers that fire from a product analytics event (first login, invited teammate, reached limit). The userTourKit library provides native `useBranch` hook integration for conditional branching paths based on application state, and its PostHog analytics plugin can sync feature flag evaluations directly as tour gate conditions. The "don't show again" persistence contract is a required companion to every trigger: without it, correctly-targeted tours re-fire on every session load and become noise.

## Key quotations / statistics

- userTourKit `useBranch` hook: "trigger conditional branching paths from step content based on user choices or application state" — enabling different tour paths based on the user's real-time context.
- userTourKit's PostHog analytics plugin: "capture tour events as PostHog actions with automatic feature flag and person property sync" — meaning PostHog feature flag evaluations can gate which tour fires without a custom integration layer.
- OneUptime segment targeting (January 2026): "Segment targeting answers: 'Should this user see this feature?' by grouping users based on shared characteristics and controlling feature availability per group." Rule-based evaluation uses attributes like plan, country, and account status; multiple segments can be stacked with priority ordering.
- Turn.io segment-based triggers (February 2026): "Dynamic evaluation: Segments are evaluated in real time, so contacts matching the segment later will also get the journey when the trigger fires." Supports both message-based and time-based trigger types gated on a named segment.
- Common trigger pattern: `shouldShowTour = !hasSeenTour && isInSegment && featureFlag.enabled` — the three-gate idiom used consistently across userTourKit and PostHog integrations.

```typescript
// Pattern: three-gate trigger (localStorage + segment + flag)
const shouldShowTour = useMemo(() => {
  const hasSeenTour = localStorage.getItem("tour:welcome-tour-v2") === "true";
  const isEligible = user.plan === "trial" && user.daysSinceSignup < 7;
  const flagEnabled = featureFlags["onboarding-tour-enabled"] === true;
  return !hasSeenTour && isEligible && flagEnabled;
}, [user, featureFlags]);
```

- userTourKit `usePersistence` hook: "save and restore tour completion state across browser sessions with localStorage or custom adapters" — the canonical persistence layer for the "don't show again" contract.
- userTourKit `useRoutePersistence` hook: "maintain tour progress when users navigate between pages in multi-page applications" — critical for Next.js App Router tours that span routes.
- userTourKit Next.js App Router adapter: "configure route-aware tours with usePathname integration for server component layouts" — native SSR-safe trigger wiring without a client-only wrapper.

## Annotations for stinger-forge

- This is the primary source for `guides/04-segment-triggers.md`. The three-gate trigger idiom (`hasSeenTour && isInSegment && flagEnabled`) maps directly to the guide's three-trigger-type taxonomy: persistence gate, segment gate, feature-flag gate.
- userTourKit is worth calling out as a 2026 OSS alternative to Driver.js / Shepherd.js that provides built-in segmentation hooks and Next.js App Router adapters — details that fill the gap in the Command Brief's "open-source libraries" discussion.
- The PostHog plugin integration with automatic feature flag sync is highly relevant for teams already using PostHog (common in the target audience). stinger-forge should include a concrete snippet for `@tour-kit/analytics` PostHog plugin setup.
- The "don't show again" persistence pattern is the most common implementation mistake — stinger-forge must place it as a "required companion" rule, not an optional enhancement, in `guides/04-segment-triggers.md`.
- Connects to `guides/06-maintenance-and-drift.md`: versioning the tour key in localStorage (e.g., `tour:welcome-tour-v2`) allows re-triggering a revised tour for users who saw an older version, which is a tour-as-code migration pattern.
- Open question: userTourKit appears to be a relatively new library (v0.11.0, May 2026). stinger-forge should note it as an "emerging alternative" and verify production stability before recommending it over Driver.js/Shepherd.js for mission-critical onboarding.
