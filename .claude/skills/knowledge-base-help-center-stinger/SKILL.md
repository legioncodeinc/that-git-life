description: Customer-facing knowledge bases — Intercom Articles, Help Scout Docs, ReadMe.com, Document360, HelpJuice, Zendesk Guide — search-first design, AI deflection (chat-with-your-docs), versioning, multi-language, the analytics-driven content-gap loop. Use when the user says "pick a KB platform", "set up a help center", "migrate Zendesk Guide", "add AI deflection to our docs", "fix our search no-results", "localize our KB", or invokes `knowledge-base-help-center-worker-bee`. Do NOT use for support inbox/ticketing (customer-support-tooling-worker-bee), live chat widget wiring (live-chat-support-worker-bee), organic SEO keyword strategy (seo-aeo-worker-bee), or RAG/embedding pipeline implementation (mind-worker-bee).

# knowledge-base-help-center Stinger

Opinionated playbook for `knowledge-base-help-center-worker-bee`. Equips the Bee to select, set up, architect, and continuously improve customer-facing self-service knowledge bases in 2026.

## 2026 Platform Landscape at a Glance

| Platform | AI Deflection | Versioning | Multi-language | MCP (2026) | Pricing |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Help Scout Docs** | AI Answers ($0.75/res) | Basic article history | Partial; no native multi-locale | No | Transparent, contact-based |
| **Intercom Articles** | Fin ($0.99/res; **standalone plan, no seats required**) | None | Fin: 45 languages; Articles: TMS workflow | No | Per-seat + usage; opaque total cost |
| **Document360** | Eddy AI (Business+ tier) | **Full branch versioning** (parallel v2+v3 simultaneously) | **50+ languages, auto-translate** (Business+) | **Yes** (v12.3.1, Mar 2026) | Quote-based (opaque; no self-serve pricing) |
| **ReadMe.com** | AI Agent + vector search | Git-backed version control | Partial | **Yes** (Apr 2026) | Tiered; Metrics API: Enterprise only |
| **Zendesk Guide** | Answer Bot / Copilot AI | Basic; no branching | Native path-based locale routing; RTL | No | Per-agent seat |
| **HelpJuice** | Unknown (2026 data gap) | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown | Contact sales |

> **Critical 2026 findings:**
> - **Intercom Fin is now available as a standalone plan** ($0.99/resolution, no Intercom seat purchase required). This reshapes the AI deflection decision for all platforms — you can pair Fin's AI deflection with any KB platform via URL/PDF ingestion.
> - **llms.txt gained Google Lighthouse validation on May 20, 2026.** Add an `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` to every KB setup as a Day-1 step for AI assistant discoverability.
> - **Document360 launched an MCP server in v12.3.1 (Mar 2026)** — Claude, ChatGPT, and Copilot can now read and write the KB directly via MCP protocol.

## Entry point for any invocation

1. Read `guides/00-platform-selection.md` — the scored decision tree. Always run this first when the platform is undecided or when a migration is proposed.
2. Read `guides/01-information-architecture.md` — taxonomy, article templates, search tagging.
3. Read `guides/02-ai-deflection.md` — the three AI deflection patterns and the hand-off protocol to `mind-worker-bee`.
4. Read the platform-specific guide for the chosen tool (`guides/06-` through `guides/09-`).
5. Read `guides/05-analytics-loop.md` last — wire the feedback loop after setup is complete.

## Critical directives

- **Run the decision tree before recommending a platform.** Platform selection without scoring against the team's actual constraints (content volume, authoring persona, versioning, AI deflection need, budget) produces the wrong answer. See `guides/00-platform-selection.md`.
- **Always name the concrete trade-off.** "Use Document360" without naming the quote-only pricing and the sales-call barrier produces buyer's regret. "Use Intercom Articles" without naming the per-seat + per-resolution cost stack produces bill shock. Source: `research/external/2026-05-20-helpscout-vs-intercom-cost-model.md`.
- **Default to search-first architecture.** A KB that cannot surface the right article in two clicks fails its primary job. Wire search analytics before any AI deflection layer.
- **Flag the llms.txt step on every new KB setup.** Google Lighthouse now validates llms.txt (May 20, 2026). It is a 10-minute Day-1 step with permanent AI assistant discoverability benefit.
- **Route embedding/RAG pipeline implementation to `mind-worker-bee`.** The three deflection patterns specify the architecture boundary; `mind-worker-bee` implements the vector retrieval side. Do not cross that boundary. See `guides/02-ai-deflection.md`.
- **Flag HelpJuice as a 2026 research gap.** No current data was found on HelpJuice AI deflection maturity, versioning, or pricing. Treat it as a placeholder in the platform matrix and direct users to helpjuice.com/whats-new before committing. See `research/research-summary.md` OQ-1.
