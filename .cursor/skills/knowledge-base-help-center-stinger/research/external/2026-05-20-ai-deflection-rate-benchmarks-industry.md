# AI Deflection Rate Benchmarks 2026 - Industry Dataset

## Summary

Buzzi.ai published a citable 2026 benchmark dataset for AI deflection rates segmented by industry and ticket complexity (simple, medium, complex). SaaS products achieve 80% deflection on simple tickets, 50% on medium, and 10% on complex. E-commerce leads at 85%/55%/10%. Lower-trust industries like legal (40%/15%/2%) and healthcare (55%/25%/3%) see significantly lower rates. These benchmarks are described as starting points, not targets, since actual deflection depends on channel mix, KB coverage, and training data maturity.

## Key Quotations / Statistics

**Deflection rate benchmarks by industry and complexity:**

| Industry | Simple | Medium | Complex |
|---|---|---|---|
| E-commerce | 85% | 55% | 10% |
| SaaS | 80% | 50% | 10% |
| Gaming | 82% | 50% | 8% |
| Retail | 75% | 45% | 8% |
| Airlines | 70% | 35% | 5% |
| Banking | 70% | 35% | 5% |
| Healthcare | 55% | 25% | 3% |
| Legal | 40% | 15% | 2% |

- "These benchmarks are starting points, not targets — your actual deflection depends on channel mix, knowledge-base coverage, and training data maturity"
- "Define eligibility windows (typically 24-72 hours for standard issues, 7 days for complex B2B)"
- "Distinguish 'true deflection' (resolved without contact) from 'assisted containment' (customer still contacts support)"

## Implementation Context

For KB-backed AI deflection to achieve benchmark rates:
- KB coverage must be high: articles must exist for top-N support topics
- Articles must be structured for AI retrieval (one question per article, answer in first 100 words)
- Eligibility window matters: a "deflected" conversation has different definitions per vendor

## Annotations for stinger-forge

- This source is the canonical benchmark reference for `guides/03-ai-deflection.md` - cite these figures when the Bee is asked "what deflection rate can we expect?"
- The SaaS benchmark (80% simple, 50% medium) is the most relevant figure for the typical user of this stinger
- The distinction between "true deflection" and "assisted containment" is critical for setting honest expectations with support teams - include this in the guide's "measuring success" section
- The 24-72 hour eligibility window definition should be included in the analytics guide (`guides/05-analytics-content-gap.md`) as part of measurement setup
- The low rates for healthcare and legal (2-3% on complex tickets) justify the Bee's directive about mandatory human escalation paths
