# Research Plan — react-stinger

**Bee:** react-worker-bee
**Forged:** 2026-04-24

## Open questions from the brief

1. Is React Native in scope? (Defer — out of scope for v1; note in `guides/00-principles.md`.)
2. Dedicated Pages Router -> App Router migration guide? (Defer — short sidebar in `11-server-components.md` with pointer to Next.js migration docs.)
3. Catalog opinionation level? (**Resolved: opinionated per command brief.** "Use X, not Y" with reasoning.)
4. Future TanStack-dedicated Bee? (Out of scope; note in `13-ecosystem-catalog.md`.)
