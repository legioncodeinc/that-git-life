## Annotations for weapon-forge

- **2026 maturity signal**: 200K+ weekly downloads and 8K stars in March 2026 puts Starlight firmly in production-ready territory. The Command Brief question "Is Starlight now stable enough to recommend over Docusaurus without caveats?" can be answered YES for new projects, with the caveat that v0.x versioning means breaking changes between minor versions.
- The Astro v6 requirement (Starlight v0.38+) is a meaningful ecosystem upgrade decision - document in `guides/07-starlight.md`.
- The Content Layer API migration requirement (from legacy content collections) is a potential friction point for existing Astro projects upgrading to Starlight v0.38+.
- Starlight vs Docusaurus: Starlight wins for Astro-native teams and those wanting framework-agnostic component support. Docusaurus wins for React-heavy teams who want the bigger plugin ecosystem.
- Document in `guides/00-platform-selection.md`: Starlight is the recommendation for new greenfield docs sites as of 2026, unless React ecosystem integration is required.
