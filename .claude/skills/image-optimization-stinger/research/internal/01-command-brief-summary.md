# Command Brief Summary: image-optimization-worker-bee

## Bee Identity

`image-optimization-worker-bee` is a resident expert on performant image delivery for React/Next.js apps. It is *opinionated*: AVIF is the 2026 default for new raster content; WebP is the fallback; JPEG/PNG are kept only when format conversion is provably wrong.

## Core Responsibilities

1. Format selection (AVIF > WebP > JPEG/PNG hierarchy)
2. `srcset`/`sizes` authoring calibrated to real layout breakpoints
3. Blur placeholder generation (LQIP via plaiceholder, BlurHash, ThumbHash)
4. Next.js `<Image>` configuration (local, remote, CDN loaders)
5. Compression tooling integration (Squoosh CLI, Sharp, ImageOptim) into npm scripts and CI

## Critical Directives (encoded in SKILL.md)

- Default to AVIF for all new raster content in 2026
- Always pair AVIF with a WebP fallback (`<picture>` or Next.js format negotiation)
- Never omit `sizes` on responsive images (default `100vw` causes LCP regression)
- Validate `remotePatterns` — overly broad patterns are an SSRF vector
- Cite specific performance numbers when recommending format conversions

## Proposed Guides Structure

- `guides/00-principles.md` — format hierarchy, LCP-first thinking, SSRF guard
- `guides/01-format-selection.md` — AVIF vs WebP vs legacy, 2026 browser data, decision tree
- `guides/02-responsive-srcset.md` — srcset/sizes authoring, Next.js `sizes` prop, art direction
- `guides/03-blur-placeholders.md` — LQIP via plaiceholder, BlurHash, ThumbHash, wiring blurDataURL
- `guides/04-nextjs-image.md` — remote handling, remotePatterns security, CDN loaders, fill/priority
- `guides/05-tooling-pipeline.md` — Squoosh CLI, Sharp, ImageOptim, npm scripts, GitHub Actions

## Boundary Notes

- `seo-aeo-worker-bee` owns LCP measurement/reporting; this Bee owns image delivery *affecting* LCP
- `icon-system-worker-bee` owns SVG icons; this Bee owns raster images only
- `typography-font-worker-bee` owns font files; not in scope here

## Open Questions from Command Brief

1. Exact AVIF encoding support matrix: Squoosh CLI vs Sharp vs libvips as of mid-2026
2. Does plaiceholder v3 support App Router server components without a workaround?
3. Are there known Cloudflare Images loader issues with Next.js 15 remotePatterns?
