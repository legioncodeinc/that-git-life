# Mintlify - The Intelligent Knowledge Platform

## Summary

Mintlify is an AI-native documentation platform targeting teams from startups to enterprise. It positions itself as "The Intelligent Knowledge Platform" with a strong emphasis on AI-powered features woven into every layer: AI Assistant (Q&A from docs content), Writing Agent (auto-generate/maintain content), MCP server, and Workflows for self-updating knowledge management. The platform uses a docs-as-code approach (MDX files + `docs.json` in Git) with automatic deployment on push. Notable customers include Anthropic (2M+ MAD), Perplexity, X, Together AI, Replit, Laravel, and Lovable.

## Key quotations / statistics

- "Helping teams create and maintain world-class documentation built for both humans and AI"

- Anthropic case study: "2M+ Monthly active developers, 3+ Products serviced: Claude API, MCP, and Claude Code"
- "Ensure your product shows up in the AI workflows users already rely on. We support llms.txt, MCP, and whatever comes next."

## Annotations for weapon-forge

- This is the platform currently dominant in the "managed + AI-native" segment. It wins over Docusaurus when speed-to-production and built-in AI features outweigh self-hosting/cost concerns.
- The MCP server feature (Mintlify MCP for dashboard access) positions it well for 2026's agent-oriented workflows.
- llms.txt support is a meaningful differentiator for teams building AI-facing products.
- The Writing Agent is a novel feature not present in any open-source alternative - document this as a key selling point in `guides/05-mintlify.md`.
- Overlap concern: Mintlify's AI Assistant replaces or supplements the need for Algolia DocSearch for conversational retrieval - document in `guides/03-search.md`.
