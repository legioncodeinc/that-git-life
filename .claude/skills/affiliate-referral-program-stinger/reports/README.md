# Reports

This folder collects past engagement outputs produced by `affiliate-referral-program-worker-bee`. Each report is a dated, product-specific instance of the final recommendation document.

## Report format

Each report is a markdown file named `YYYY-MM-DD-<product-slug>-affiliate-audit.md` and contains:

1. **Summary** -- One paragraph with the top recommendation and economic verdict.
2. **Platform recommendation** -- Selected platform with rationale and break-even math.
3. **Attribution architecture** -- Selected method, Safari ITP disclosure, implementation steps.
4. **Commission configuration** -- Rate, recurrence, hold period, payout mechanics.
5. **Fraud controls** -- Configured controls, platform-native vs supplemental.
6. **Economics model** -- Filled `templates/program-config-spec.md` economics table.
7. **Handoffs** -- Named peer Bees and what they need to take over.

## Accumulation

Reports accumulate here over time as the Bee handles engagements. They serve as an audit trail and a corpus of worked examples for future invocations. Do not delete old reports -- they are reference material for calibrating benchmarks against real-world program data.
