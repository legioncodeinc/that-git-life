description: Paid acquisition specialist for alternative ad platforms beyond Meta and Google Search — LinkedIn Ads (B2B), TikTok Ads + CAPI, Reddit Ads, Microsoft/Bing Ads with LinkedIn Profile Targeting, Pinterest Ads, Quora Ads, YouTube standalone video, Spotify Ad Studio + podcast advertising, and the channel-fit-by-ICP heuristic that selects among them. Invoke when the user says "which ad platform should I use besides Meta/Google", "set up LinkedIn Ads for B2B SaaS", "TikTok CAPI setup", "Reddit Ads for technical buyers", "Microsoft Ads LinkedIn targeting", "podcast advertising Spotify Ad Studio", "channel diversification paid acquisition", or "our CPL on Meta is too high, what else should we try". Do NOT invoke for Meta/Facebook/Instagram Ads (no peer Bee — handle inline), Google Search Ads (no peer Bee — handle inline), or organic social strategy (route to social-media-marketing-organic-worker-bee).

# alt-ads-platforms Stinger

Arsenal for `alt-ads-platforms-worker-bee` — the Legion Army's specialist for paid acquisition across the 10 alternative platforms: LinkedIn, TikTok, Reddit, Microsoft/Bing, X/Twitter, Pinterest, Quora, YouTube (standalone), Spotify Ad Studio, and the podcast advertising ecosystem.

**Always start with `guides/01-channel-fit-diagnosis.md`.** No platform setup work begins until the ICP-to-platform fit is scored and the channel stack is prioritized. Running LinkedIn campaigns for a consumer ICP, or TikTok campaigns below $50/day, wastes budget regardless of execution quality.

See `guides/00-principles.md` for the six non-negotiables.

## Critical directives

- **Channel-fit diagnosis before setup.** Never scaffold a campaign architecture before running the ICP-to-platform scoring. An incorrectly selected channel cannot be rescued by good execution. See `guides/00-principles.md`.

- **Minimum viable spend thresholds are gates, not guidelines.** LinkedIn under $1,500/month produces unoptimizable data. TikTok under $50/day has no learning phase. State these thresholds explicitly when the budget is below them. See `guides/00-principles.md`.

- **CAPI is the 2026 baseline for TikTok and LinkedIn.** Pixel-only attribution is ~60-70% accurate post-iOS 14.5. Server-side CAPI is not optional. See `guides/12-capi-wiring.md`.

- **Depth over breadth.** Never recommend more platforms than the team can execute well. One well-run LinkedIn campaign beats three mediocre ones across three platforms. See `guides/00-principles.md`.

- **Benchmark CPLs are ranges, not targets.** Initial testing will typically be 2-3x above mature-campaign benchmarks. State this explicitly. See `guides/01-channel-fit-diagnosis.md`.

- **X/Twitter is the most volatile platform in this stinger's universe.** The X/Twitter guide requires quarterly review. Always flag this to the user. See `guides/06-x-twitter-ads.md`.

## Open questions (from scripture-historian)

The following questions require either human decision or direct platform verification before the relevant guides can be fully authoritative. See `research/research-summary.md` for full context.

> **OQ-1 (LinkedIn CAPI GA status):** LinkedIn Conversions API availability depends on account type and may require applying for access. Verify in Campaign Manager: Measure > Conversions > Connect to partner. See `guides/12-capi-wiring.md` note.

> **OQ-2 (X/Twitter 2026 stability):** No 2026-specific X/Twitter Ads platform data was found in research. `guides/06-x-twitter-ads.md` is synthesized from training knowledge; verify at [business.twitter.com](https://business.twitter.com) before acting.

> **OQ-3 (Quora 2026 traffic):** Quora B2B effectiveness survives AI competition for technical comparison queries but is no longer a mass-volume channel. Scale expectations should be conservative.
