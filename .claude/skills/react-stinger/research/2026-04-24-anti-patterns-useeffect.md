## Summary

The most common React anti-pattern, still prevalent in 2026, is using `useEffect` to compute derived state or to sync props into state. React's official guide "You Might Not Need an Effect" names six scenarios where the effect is wrong:

1. Transforming data for rendering — do it during render.
2. Caching expensive computation — use `useMemo`.
3. Resetting state on prop change — use `key` prop.
4. Adjusting state on prop change — use a render-phase check or compute during render.
5. Chains of effects updating state — collapse into one handler.
6. Notifying parent — pass the event up, don't ripple through effects.

## Canonical fixes

### Bad
```tsx
const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');
useEffect(() => {
  setFullName(`${first} ${last}`);
}, [first, last]);
```

### Good
```tsx
const fullName = `${first} ${last}`;
```

### Bad (resetting on prop change)
```tsx
useEffect(() => { setSelection(null); }, [listId]);
```

### Good
```tsx
<List key={listId} items={items} />
// State resets when key changes — no effect needed.
```

## Other common anti-patterns in 2026

1. **Barrel files (`index.ts` re-exports)** — kill tree-shaking, slow builds, hide circular deps. Import directly.
2. **Deep prop drilling** — 4+ levels; use composition (children) or a local context.
3. **Premature memoization** — `useMemo(() => x + 1, [x])`. Meaningless. Delete. Especially meaningless under React Compiler.
4. **`any` escape hatch** — `const x = data as any`. Use Zod or a discriminated union.
5. **Client component at the root** — `'use client'` on the page. Forces whole tree into client bundle.
6. **Fetch inside a deep leaf component** — waterfalls, no caching. Lift to a loader / Server Component / data hook.
7. **Ignoring React keys** — list items without stable keys lose state on reorder.
8. **Mutating state directly** — `state.push(x)` instead of `setState([...state, x])`. Breaks Compiler.
