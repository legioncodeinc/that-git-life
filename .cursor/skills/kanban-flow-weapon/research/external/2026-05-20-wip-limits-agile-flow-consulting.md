# Kanban WIP Limits: Practitioner Guide 2026

## Summary

This practitioner guide for software teams covers the fundamentals of Kanban with strong emphasis on WIP limits as the single most impactful practice a team can implement. The author frames WIP limits as a mathematical forcing function grounded in Little's Law: if a team completes 5 items per week with 20 items in progress, average cycle time is 4 weeks; reduce WIP to 10 and cycle time drops to 2 weeks — no extra effort required.

The guide provides a concrete case study: a 12-person engineering and analytics team at a major energy provider was running an average of 14 items in progress. After introducing throughput-derived WIP limits (not arbitrary caps), WIP dropped to 5 and the 85th-percentile cycle time fell from 62 days to 36 days — a 42% reduction. The team did not work harder; they simply stopped starting new work before finishing existing work.

Key WIP-setting heuristic from the article: count current in-progress items, set the initial WIP limit to that count minus one. This creates the minimum friction needed to start changing behavior without provoking wholesale rejection.

The article distinguishes clearly between Kanban (the method with WIP limits, flow measurement, explicit policies) and a Kanban board (a visual tool that many Scrum teams use without practicing Kanban). The guide explicitly states that a Scrum team using a board without WIP limits is NOT practicing Kanban.

Explicit Kanban use-case triggers: (a) mix of planned work and unplanned production support, (b) sprint commitments are difficult due to external dependencies blocking mid-sprint, (c) work types have wildly different durations, (d) team tried Scrum and found ceremony overhead added friction without improving delivery.

For Scrumban hybrid: recommended when teams have long-running workflows, external dependencies, or are embedded in large-scale program increments.

## Key quotations / statistics

- "Of all Kanban's practices, WIP limits generate the most resistance, and deliver the most impact."
- "If your team completes 5 items per week and has 20 items in progress, your average cycle time is 4 weeks. Reduce WIP to 10 items, without anyone working harder or faster, and your average cycle time drops to 2 weeks."
- "A 12-person engineering and analytics team... 85th-percentile cycle time fell from 62 days to 36 days: a 42% reduction."
- "Step 2: Set an initial WIP limit. Count how many items are currently in progress across your team. Set your WIP limit to that number minus one."

## Annotations for weapon-forge

- **Critical** for `guides/01-wip-limits.md`: provides the "current WIP minus one" starting heuristic, the throughput-derived limit methodology, and the 42% cycle time improvement case study.
- **Supports** `guides/03-littles-law.md`: directly illustrates L = λW in the WIP-to-cycle-time relationship with concrete numeric examples.
- **Supports** `guides/07-kanban-vs-scrum.md`: includes four concrete triggers for choosing Kanban and a recommendation for Scrumban in hybrid contexts.
- The "not a board, it's a method" framing is a direct match for the guardian's critical directive: "Do not conflate Kanban (method) with Kanban board (tool)."
