# MkDocs Material — Maintenance Mode Guidance

**Status: MAINTENANCE MODE since November 2025.** No new features. Security and critical bug fixes only until approximately November 2026. The creator (Martin Donath) is building Zensical as the successor — no public release date.

## Decision rules

**DO NOT start a new project on MkDocs Material in 2026.**

If the team is considering MkDocs Material for a new project, route to `guides/00-platform-selection.md` and select a different platform. For Python projects, consider Starlight (Astro) or Docusaurus — both support Python code examples well.

**Existing MkDocs Material sites:** continue using it. The platform is stable for maintenance. Upgrade to 9.7.0 to get all previously-Insiders features for free.

## 2026 positive change: 9.7.0 opens all Insiders features

MkDocs Material 9.7.0 (released alongside the maintenance mode announcement) made all previously-Insiders features available in the community edition at no cost:
- Blog plugin
- Tags plugin with tree structure
- Privacy plugin (external asset download for GDPR compliance)
- Social cards (auto-generated OG images)
- Optimize plugin (image compression)
- Projects plugin (multi-project builds)

Upgrade existing sites to 9.7.0:
```bash
pip install mkdocs-material==9.7.0
```

## Migration path

When ready to migrate away from MkDocs Material:

1. **Inventory current content:** list all `.md` pages, nav structure, custom CSS/macros, and plugins used.
2. **Choose target platform:** Starlight (Astro) for similar Markdown-first experience; Docusaurus for React/MDX power users.
3. **Convert frontmatter:** MkDocs uses YAML frontmatter; Starlight and Docusaurus also use YAML frontmatter — most pages transfer directly.
4. **Port navigation:** map `mkdocs.yml` `nav:` to the target platform's sidebar config.
5. **Port custom CSS:** extract color and spacing overrides to the new platform's token system.
6. **Port macros/plugins:** MkDocs Jinja macros have no direct equivalent in JS platforms — convert to MDX components.

Use `templates/migration-checklist.md` for the step-by-step migration.
