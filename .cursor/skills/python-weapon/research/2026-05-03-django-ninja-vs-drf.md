## Summary

Django Ninja is FastAPI-style (decorator-per-endpoint, Pydantic v2 schemas, type hints drive validation and OpenAPI doc generation) and integrates with the Django ORM. DRF is the older, mature alternative with a heavier serializer + viewset + router stack. Production teams (Kogan, others) report consistent wins with Ninja: less boilerplate, automatic OpenAPI / Swagger / ReDoc docs, automatic request validation, response serialization driven by the declared `response=` schema, and a more readable function-based view shape.

## Key facts the active guides depend on

- Ninja's `Schema` class is a Pydantic `BaseModel` subclass with `model_config = ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)` set — meaning a `Schema` can validate against a Django model instance directly. Source: `ninja/schema.py`.
- `ModelSchema` derives a Pydantic schema automatically from a Django model with `fields = [...]` or `exclude = [...]` discipline. Source: Django Ninja "Generating a Schema dynamically" docs.
- DRF's serializer/viewset stack is acceptable in legacy code but verbose; the canonical migration is incremental — new endpoints land on Ninja, old DRF endpoints migrate when touched.
- Ninja supports async view functions natively. DRF's async support exists but lags.

## Relevance to the Weapon

- **`guides/05-django-ninja-api.md`** — canonical API layer.
- **`guides/01-stack-enforcement.md`** — Ninja over DRF as a Hard Rule.
- **`examples/07-drf-to-django-ninja-migration.md`** — phased migration plan with parity checklist.
- **`references/drf-comparison.md`** — DRF as preserved alternative; legacy-recognition guidance.
