# Phase 10: Webhook & Outbound Integration System

> **Site Template Guide** — PRD Phase 10 of 12

---

## Phase Overview

### Goals

Event-driven outbound webhooks with HMAC-SHA256 signing, exponential-backoff retry, delivery log, and an admin-accessible delivery history page. In Payload CMS mode, Payload `afterChange` hooks trigger content-driven events (e.g., `post.published`). Business events (e.g., `lead.created`) are triggered from SvelteKit form actions.

### Scope

**In scope:**
- `public.webhook_endpoints` and `public.webhook_deliveries` tables
- `supabase/functions/notify-webhook/` — delivery + HMAC signature
- Payload `afterChange` hook for `post.published` event (Payload mode only)
- `src/routes/admin/webhooks/+page.server.ts` — delivery history UI
- User-Agent header value configurable via `app_settings` (not hardcoded)

**Out of scope:**
- Inbound webhook processing (add separately if needed)
- Retry cron job (mentioned as a future enhancement — manual retry via admin UI is sufficient at launch)

### Dependencies

- Phase 5: `public` schema tables established; RLS in place
- Phase 6: Admin route protection for `/admin/webhooks`
- Phase 7 (Payload mode): Payload `posts` collection with `afterChange` hook support

## User Stories

### Story 1 — Admin: Register a Webhook Endpoint

> As an **Admin**, I want to register an outbound webhook URL that receives events when leads are captured or posts are published, so that I can trigger downstream automation.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- `/admin/webhooks` page allows creating endpoints with: name, URL, secret (auto-generated), event subscriptions
- Saved endpoint visible in the Supabase `webhook_endpoints` table
- Admin can deactivate an endpoint without deleting it

### Story 2 — System: Deliver a Signed Webhook

> As the **System**, I want each webhook delivery to include an HMAC-SHA256 signature so that the receiving endpoint can verify authenticity.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- `X-Webhook-Signature: sha256=<hex>` header present on every delivery
- Signature is `HMAC-SHA256(endpoint.secret, JSON.stringify(payload))`
- `X-Webhook-Event: <event_type>` header also present
- User-Agent configurable via `app_settings.webhooks.user_agent` (default `Site-Webhook/1.0` — no hardcoded brand name)

### Story 3 — Admin: View Delivery History

> As an **Admin**, I want to view the last 100 webhook deliveries with their status, event type, and response code so that I can diagnose integration failures.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- `/admin/webhooks` (or `/admin/webhooks/deliveries`) lists deliveries ordered by `created_at` desc
- Each row shows: endpoint name, event type, status (pending/success/failed/retrying), HTTP response code, timestamp
- Admin can retry a failed delivery manually

## Data Model

### public.webhook_endpoints

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.webhook_endpoints (
  id         uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name       text NOT NULL,
  url        text NOT NULL,
  secret     text NOT NULL,
  events     text[] NOT NULL,  -- e.g. {'lead.created', 'post.published'}
  is_active  boolean DEFAULT true,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

### public.webhook_deliveries

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.webhook_deliveries (
  id              uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  endpoint_id     uuid REFERENCES public.webhook_endpoints(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  event_type      text NOT NULL,
  payload         jsonb NOT NULL,
  status          text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',  -- pending|success|failed|retrying
  response_status int,
  response_body   text,
  attempts        int DEFAULT 0,
  next_retry_at   timestamptz,
  created_at      timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  delivered_at    timestamptz
);
```

## Event Types

| Event | Trigger | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| `lead.created` | SvelteKit form action (Phase 8) | Lead data (name, email, source, UTM) |
| `post.published` | Payload `afterChange` hook (Payload mode) | Post title, slug, publishedAt |
| `user.registered` | Supabase Auth `INSERT` trigger | User email, created_at |

Custom event types are configurable by adding to the `events` array on a webhook endpoint.

---

## HMAC Signature

```ts
import { createHmac } from 'node:crypto';

const signature = createHmac('sha256', endpoint.secret)
  .update(JSON.stringify(payload))
  .digest('hex');

// Header value: `sha256=${signature}`
```

Receiving endpoint verification (Node.js example):
```ts
const expected = 'sha256=' + createHmac('sha256', secret).update(rawBody).digest('hex');
if (received !== expected) throw new Error('Invalid signature');
```

---

## User-Agent Configuration

The `notify-webhook` Edge Function reads the User-Agent from `app_settings`:

```ts
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('app_settings')
  .select('value')
  .eq('category', 'webhooks')
  .eq('key', 'user_agent')
  .single();

const userAgent = (data?.value as string) ?? 'Site-Webhook/1.0';
```

Default seed in `app-settings-seed.sql`:
```sql
INSERT INTO public.app_settings (category, key, value)
VALUES ('webhooks', 'user_agent', '"Site-Webhook/1.0"');
```

No brand name or domain is hardcoded in the Edge Function.

## Risks and Open Questions

- **R-1:** The `notify-webhook` function has no retry cron job in this phase. Failed deliveries sit at `status = 'failed'` until manually retried from the admin UI. Add a Supabase cron job (via `pg_cron` extension) for automated retry in a follow-up phase.
- **R-2:** Webhook delivery is fire-and-forget from the SvelteKit form action's perspective. If the Edge Function is slow (Supabase cold start), the user's form submission response is not delayed — but the webhook may be dropped if the Edge Function times out. Consider a Supabase database trigger instead of an HTTP call from the form action.
- **Q-1:** Should webhook secrets be auto-generated (UUID-based) at endpoint creation, or should admins provide their own? Auto-generation is safer (consistent entropy) but means secrets are not memorable. Auto-generate and display once on creation.
