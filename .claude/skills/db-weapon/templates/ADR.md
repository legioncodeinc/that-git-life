# ADR-{{NUMBER}}: {{TITLE}}

**Status:** {{Proposed | Accepted | Superseded by ADR-XXX | Deprecated}}
**Date:** {{YYYY-MM-DD}}
**Author:** {{name / role}}
**Stakeholders:** {{eng leads, DBA if applicable, security lead if data is sensitive}}

## Context

{{What is the situation that forces a decision?
Include:
- Postgres major version, ORM, platform.
- Workload shape — read/write ratio, expected row counts, latency targets, geographic distribution.
- Constraints — team SQL fluency, runtime (edge / serverless / long-running), budget, RPO/RTO.
- Why the status quo cannot continue.
}}

## Decision

{{What will we do? Be specific. One paragraph + DDL or schema snippet if helpful.}}

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- {{expected gain, measured or predicted}}

**Negative:**
- {{cost, risk, or trade-off}}

**Neutral:**
- {{a change that's neither a win nor a loss but worth documenting}}

## Alternatives considered

- **{{Alt 1}}** — {{why rejected}}
- **{{Alt 2}}** — {{why rejected}}

## References

- `guides/XX-...md §section`
- `research/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`
- {{external URL — postgresql.org docs preferred}}

## Verification

{{How do we prove this ADR works? What metric, query plan, or migration outcome must pass before we mark it "Accepted" / "Implemented"?
For schema decisions: a representative `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` showing the expected plan.
For migration decisions: lock duration measurements from a staging dry-run.
For platform choice: cost / latency benchmarks at expected workload.
