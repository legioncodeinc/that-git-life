# Example: Node API with multi-arch (amd64 + arm64) + Trivy gate

A worked example for a Node API serving multi-arch consumers (Apple Silicon dev + Graviton prod). Source: `guides/02-multi-arch-builds.md`, `guides/04-image-scanning.md`.

---

## Stack

- Node 20 API (Fastify, no framework-specific Docker concerns).
- Consumers: Apple Silicon dev workstations + AWS Graviton (arm64) production fleet.
- GHCR for image registry.
- Depot for native multi-arch builds.
- Trivy CRITICAL/HIGH gate on PRs.

## Why multi-arch matters here

- Devs on M-series Macs running the image without QEMU = no slow emulation, no surprise native-module breakage.
- Production on Graviton = 20-40% cheaper than equivalent x86 EC2.

## PR build — amd64 only, Trivy gates

```yaml
name: PR build

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

concurrency:
  group: pr-build-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

## Main deploy — multi-arch push to GHCR

```yaml

      - uses: depot/setup-action@<sha>

      - name: Build + push multi-arch
        uses: depot/build-push-action@<sha>

          severity: CRITICAL,HIGH

          exit-code: 0    # PR build is the gate; here we report
```

## Why amd64-only on PRs but multi-arch on main

- PR builds get reviewed and re-built on every push. Cutting arm64 (4-10x slower under QEMU on a free runner — without Depot, anyway) makes PRs faster. With Depot, both archs are native, so this is mostly habit.
- Main builds run once per merge and ship to production. arm64 must be built and pushed.

If your team is fully on Depot, building multi-arch on PRs is fine — both arches are native and fast.

## Local dev

```bash
# build for local arch only
make build TAG=local

# or via Bake
depot bake api

# multi-arch local (rare — for debugging arm64 from amd64 host)
docker buildx bake api-multiarch
```

## Outcomes

- PR build: ~70 sec warm (amd64-only), ~2.5 min cold.
- Main deploy: ~2 min build (multi-arch native via Depot), ~30 sec push.
- Trivy gate catches regressions; scheduled rescan picks up new CVEs.
- Devs on M-series pull the arm64 manifest — no QEMU, no surprises.
