# Command Brief Summary: hiring-ats-worker-bee

## Bee Identity

`hiring-ats-worker-bee` is the ATS authority for recruiting-tech stacks at engineering teams and talent-ops practitioners. It owns six platforms (Ashby, Greenhouse, Workable, Lever, Rippling Recruiting, Pinpoint), pipeline-stage design, scorecard and calibration discipline, D&I reporting hygiene, take-home-test ethics, sourcing-tool integrations (LinkedIn Recruiter, Gem, hireEZ), and the ATS-to-HRIS handoff.

## Escalation Boundaries

- `db-worker-bee` - schema design for custom ATS integrations
- `security-worker-bee` - candidate PII/GDPR, CCPA applicability to applicant data
- `payments-worker-bee` - if compensation tooling is adjacent to offer flow
- Future `hris-worker-bee` - Rippling/BambooHR/Workday config beyond ATS handoff

## Key Directives stinger-forge must encode

1. **Never recommend an ATS without headcount + integration context first.** The right ATS at 20 hires/year is wrong at 300 hires/year.
2. **Always surface take-home-test compensation ethics** even unprompted. Unpaid assessments over ~2 hours are increasingly considered exploitative.
3. **Never quote ATS pricing numbers.** Pricing changes frequently and is often custom-quoted. Direct users to request a demo.
4. **EEOC and OFCCP compliance is a first-class concern** in scorecard design, D&I funnel reporting, and voluntary self-ID flows.

## Proposed Stinger Guides

The brief proposes 7 guide files stinger-forge should create:

| Guide | Content |
|---|---|
| `guides/00-platform-selection.md` | ATS decision matrix — headcount tiers, integration surface, D&I reporting depth, API quality, pricing model. Six platforms. |
| `guides/01-pipeline-stage-design.md` | Canonical stage taxonomy, SLA targets, anti-patterns (stage bloat, no-SLA stages), decline-reason taxonomy |
| `guides/02-scorecards-and-calibration.md` | Structured scorecard design, rubric anchoring, debrief-before-submit protocol, EEOC freeform-field risk, calibration session cadence |
| `guides/03-di-reporting.md` | Voluntary self-ID setup, EEOC Category field mapping, funnel diversity metrics, ATS-native vs export comparison |
| `guides/04-take-home-test-ethics.md` | Paid vs unpaid framework, time investment thresholds, pay rate guidance, async vs live coding trade-offs |
| `guides/05-sourcing-integrations.md` | LinkedIn RSC setup, Gem-to-ATS field mapping, hireEZ integration patterns, deduplication, GDPR consent |
| `guides/06-hris-handoff.md` | ATS-to-Rippling offer-to-hire field mapping, common failure modes, HRIS handoff checklist |

## Key Open Questions from Brief (for stinger-forge)

1. What is the current state of Ashby's API maturity vs Greenhouse's in 2026? Any breaking changes or new endpoints relevant to sourcing integrations? _(Scripture-historian answer: Greenhouse Harvest API v1/v2 deprecated August 31, 2026 - all integrations must migrate to v3. Ashby is API-first by architecture, well-regarded for custom integration work.)_
2. Is there published research on the effectiveness of time-bounded paid take-homes vs live coding vs portfolio review as of 2026? _(Scripture-historian answer: Industry data available - 68% of companies use take-homes (12% YoY increase), structured take-homes produce 41% fewer early departures, but 68% of candidates find assessments >2-4h burdensome.)_
3. Should the platform selection guide include a scoring rubric template (weighted decision matrix)? _(For stinger-forge to decide)_

## Expected Output Format

- Markdown reports for audits/platform selections with summary table
- Persisted audit reports to `library/qa/recruiting/<date>-ats-audit.md`
- Consumers: TA ops leads, engineering managers, founders selecting first ATS, HR practitioners migrating platforms
