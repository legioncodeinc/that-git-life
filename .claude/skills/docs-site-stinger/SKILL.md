description: Documentation-site infrastructure specialist — platform selection (Docusaurus v3/v4, Mintlify, GitBook, MkDocs Material, Nextra v4, Starlight/Astro, Fern), the Diátaxis content pyramid, docs-as-code CI pipelines, and search setup (Algolia DocSearch, pagefind). Use when the user says "pick a docs platform", "set up Docusaurus", "migrate from GitBook", "add search to our docs", "docs-as-code CI", "Mintlify vs Starlight", or invokes `docs-site-worker-bee`. Do NOT use for OpenAPI spec enrichment or SDK generation (api-docs-worker-bee), internal knowledge-base authoring (library-worker-bee), or marketing website builds (website-worker-bee).

# docs-site Stinger

Opinionated playbook for `docs-site-worker-bee`. Equips the Bee to select, set up, and maintain developer-facing documentation sites in 2026.

## 2026 Platform Landscape at a Glance

| Platform | Status | Best for | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Starlight (Astro)** | Active, v0.38+, 200K+ weekly downloads | Greenfield open-source / developer docs | **Recommend for new projects** |
| **Docusaurus v3.10** | v3.x final release; v4 incoming (React 19) | Complex versioned docs with React components | Recommend; enable v4 flags now |
| **Mintlify** | Active; headless mode (Enterprise, Feb 2026) | API-first managed docs with fast time-to-ship | Recommend with pricing caveat |
| **MkDocs Material** | **MAINTENANCE MODE (Nov 2025)** | Python projects already on MkDocs | Do NOT recommend for new projects |
| **Nextra v4** | Active, App Router-based | Next.js teams wanting docs in same repo | Recommend for JS monorepos |
| **GitBook** | Active, per-site pricing | Non-technical authors, block editor UX | Recommend for mixed-audience docs |
| **Fern** | Active; MCP + llms.txt auto-gen 2026 | API-first docs + SDK generation combined | Recommend for API portals |

> **Critical 2026 finding:** MkDocs Material entered maintenance mode in November 2025. No new features; security fixes only until November 2026. Do NOT start new projects on MkDocs Material. Existing users can evaluate Zensical (successor, no public release date yet). Source: `research/external/2026-05-20-mkdocs-material-maintenance-mode.md`.

## Entry point for any invocation

1. Read `guides/00-platform-selection.md` — the scored decision tree. Always run this first when the platform is undecided.
2. Read `guides/01-content-pyramid.md` — the Diátaxis model for structuring documentation content.
3. Read the platform-specific guide for the chosen tool (`guides/04-` through `guides/09-`).
4. Read `guides/02-docs-as-code.md` for CI/lint/preview setup.
5. Read `guides/03-search.md` for search configuration.

## Critical directives

- **Always check platform status before recommending.** MkDocs Material is in maintenance mode as of Nov 2025 (`research/external/2026-05-20-mkdocs-material-maintenance-mode.md`). Docusaurus v4 is incoming; start v3.10 with future flags. Do not recommend stale platforms without flagging the risk.
- **Run the decision tree before picking a platform.** Platform selection without scoring the team's actual constraints (content type, hosting model, cost, customization depth) produces the wrong answer. See `guides/00-platform-selection.md`.
- **Default to docs-as-code.** PR-gated, lint-checked, preview-deployed documentation is the minimum. See `guides/02-docs-as-code.md`.
- **Treat search as required, not optional.** An undiscoverable docs site is worse than no docs site. See `guides/03-search.md`.
- **Route OpenAPI concerns to `api-docs-worker-bee`.** Docs-site-worker-bee wires the reference section into the site but does not author OpenAPI specs or SDK generation.
