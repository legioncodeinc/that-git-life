## Step 2: Compliance (2 days before submission)

### Privacy nutrition label

FocusFlow data collection audit:

| Data type | Collected? | Linked to identity? | Used for tracking? |
|---|---|---|---|
| User ID | Yes (auth) | Yes | No |
| Email | Yes (auth) | Yes | No |
| Usage data — product interaction | Yes (analytics: PostHog) | Yes | No |
| Diagnostics — crash data | Yes (Sentry) | No | No |

Nutrition label declarations:
- "Contact Info > Email Address" — linked to identity, analytics + app functionality
- "Identifiers > User ID" — linked to identity, app functionality
- "Usage Data > Product Interaction" — linked to identity, analytics
- "Diagnostics > Crash Data" — not linked, analytics

### PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy audit

Libraries in use: PostHog iOS SDK, Sentry iOS SDK, StoreKit 2 (system), RevenueCat iOS SDK

RevenueCat SDK check: RevenueCat ships `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` as of SDK v4.32+. Verify with `pod spec cat RevenueCatUI` or in Xcode Package navigator.

Required-reason API exposure in FocusFlow:
- `UserDefaults` (used for settings storage): required by app — declare reason `CA92.1` (app-owned defaults only)
- No system boot time, file timestamps, disk space, or active keyboard APIs in use

Result: No SDK-level PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy gap. Manifest complete.

### Age rating questionnaire

FocusFlow questionnaire answers:
- Cartoon violence: None
- Mature/suggestive themes: None  
- Gambling: None
- Health/medical: None (productivity timer)
- Infrequent/mild simulated gambling: None

Result: **4+** (no age-restricted content)

2. RevenueCat's bundled PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy prevented what would otherwise have been a compliance rejection
3. Providing demo credentials eliminated the chance of "we could not complete review" rejection
4. The 7-day free trial was accepted without issue under Guideline 3.1.2 (subscription terms visible at point of conversion)
