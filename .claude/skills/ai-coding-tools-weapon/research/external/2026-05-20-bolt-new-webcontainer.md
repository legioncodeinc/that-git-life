# Bolt.new WebContainer Limitations and Rapid Scaffolding (2026)

## Summary

Bolt.new is StackBlitz's browser-based rapid-scaffold agent that runs full-stack applications in WebContainer (Node.js running in the browser via WebAssembly). Its key differentiator is zero-server-cost local execution; its key limitation is that native binaries and OS-level tooling do not work. Bolt v2 added autonomous debugging reported to reduce error loops by 98%.

## Key quotations / statistics

- "Bolt.new runs full-stack applications in StackBlitz's WebContainer — a Node.js runtime executing in the browser via WebAssembly rather than on remote servers."
- "Native binaries and OS-level tooling don't work — packages requiring system libraries or native compilation fail."
- "Most modern web projects avoid these limits; projects that hit them typically needed a real server anyway."
- "Bolt provides near-instant feedback because the WebContainer runs locally in your browser — no network latency for code execution, instant package installation, and immediate dev server startup."
- "Bolt v2 added autonomous debugging that reportedly reduces error loops by 98%."

## WebContainer hard limitations

| Limitation | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Native binaries | Not supported (no C/C++/Rust native modules, no ffmpeg, etc.) |
| System libraries | Unavailable (no libssl, libc custom builds, etc.) |
| Long-running background services | Must fit in browser's process model |
| OS-specific behaviors | Unavailable or differ from server behavior |
| Device performance | Underpowered devices may struggle with heavy projects |

## Best practices for Bolt.new prompting

From the 2026 prompting guide:

1. **Specify tech stack explicitly**: Name frameworks in initial prompt (Astro, React, Next.js)
2. **Acknowledge WebContainer constraints upfront**: One line like "Runs in Bolt's WebContainer; prefer pure-JS dependencies and avoid anything that needs native binaries"
3. **Write app-level briefs, not component requests**: Bolt's unit of work is a full application
4. **Batch simple instructions**: Combine multiple changes in one message to reduce API consumption
5. **Scaffold basics first**: Establish application foundation before adding advanced features

## Bolt vs Replit Agent for rapid scaffolding

- **Bolt.new**: Browser-based WebContainer, instant feedback, no cloud costs for execution, best for pure-JS stacks
- **Replit Agent**: Cloud-native execution, supports native binaries, includes built-in databases/auth/deployment, best for full-stack apps needing server resources

## Annotations for weapon-forge

- `guides/00-tool-tiers.md`: Bolt belongs firmly in "rapid-scaffold" tier. Its WebContainer constraint is the primary selector against it — any project needing native binaries should route to Replit Agent instead.
- `guides/05-footguns.md`: The native binary limitation is the most common Bolt footgun. Developers hit it when pulling npm packages with native compilation steps (bcrypt, sharp, canvas). Add a "check for native deps first" callout.
- The "app-level brief" prompting pattern is worth surfacing in `guides/04-prompt-and-context-discipline.md` as a Bolt-specific tip
- Cross-link to the Replit Agent section: "If your Bolt app needs a real server, migrate to Replit Agent rather than fighting WebContainer limits"
