# Userback: AI-Powered Feedback Widget + Feature Portal

## Summary
Userback has evolved from a pure bug-reporting widget into a complete product management platform. The widget now serves as an engagement hub that embeds the Feature Portal, public roadmap, and announcements directly inside the product. The Feature Portal (also called Ideas Portal) collects, prioritizes, and showcases feedback with a public roadmap integrated as a status-driven extension of the portal. Automatic voter notifications fire when a status moves to "Shipped."

## Key quotations / statistics
- "Transform your widget into an engagement hub. Embed your Feature Portal, roadmap, announcements, or custom links. One widget, multiple touch-points for user interaction."
- "The Feature Portal is a public-facing space where your users can submit ideas, vote on existing ones, and follow the progress of what you're building. It brings together three things in one place: Ideas, Roadmap."
- "Embed it in your Userback widget: If you're using the Userback widget in your site or app, you can surface the portal directly inside the widget. Users can either view it inline, be redirected to the portal URL, or have it open in a new tab."
- "When an idea moves from your roadmap to reality, let the users who voted on it know it's been shipped. With Automatic Voter Notifications, this is no longer a manual process."
- Status model: `Under Review → Planned → In Progress → Shipped`
- "Public status: a way for you to simplify your internal Userback status workflow onto your public roadmap by assigning multiple internal statuses to a single public status."
- Moderation option allows controlling which submitted ideas go public vs. stay in review.
- "Join over 20,000 teams building better with Userback's public roadmaps"

## Annotations for weapon-forge
- **CONFIRMS the Command Brief question:** Userback DOES have a public ideas/voting board (Feature Portal) as of 2026. It is not just a screenshot/bug tool. This directly resolves the uncertainty flagged in the brief.
- This is the primary source for `guides/01-collection-surface-taxonomy.md` — Userback demonstrates the "all three in one widget" pattern (in-app widget + portal + public roadmap).
- The "Public status" feature (mapping many internal statuses to simplified public statuses) is a key detail for `guides/03-status-transition-policy.md`.
- Moderation config (auto-public vs. review queue) is an important decision point for the collection surface taxonomy guide.
- The widget redirect-to-portal pattern (vs. inline embed) is a concrete UX choice to document.
