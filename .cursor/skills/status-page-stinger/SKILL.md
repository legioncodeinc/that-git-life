name: status-page-stinger
description: Public status page specialist for React/Next.js and SaaS products — platform selection (Statuspage/Atlassian, Better Stack, Instatus, Cachet OSS), component tree architecture, incident communication templates (initial/update/resolution), subscriber notification setup (email, SMS, webhook, Slack), GDPR/CAN-SPAM compliance for notification lists, post-incident update discipline, and API-driven automation integration. Use when the user says "set up a status page", "which status page tool should we use", "write an incident communication template", "configure subscriber notifications", "migrate from Statuspage", "audit our incident communication", "post-mortem cross-link", "maintenance window announcement", or when `status-page-worker-bee` is invoked. Do NOT use for configuring monitoring/alerting infrastructure (devops-worker-bee), on-call rotation setup (devops-worker-bee), observability dashboards (devops-worker-bee), or operational runbook authorship (runbook-writing-worker-bee).

# Status Page Stinger

Public status page playbook — from platform selection through post-incident discipline. Backed by May 2026 research on pricing, API surfaces, and practitioner communication norms.

Command Brief: `ai-tools/command-briefs/status-page-worker-bee-command-brief.md`
Research: `ai-tools/skills/status-page-stinger/research/research-summary.md`

## When this stinger applies

Load this stinger when `status-page-worker-bee` is invoked. Typical triggers:

- "Set up a status page for our SaaS product"
- "Which status page tool should we use — Statuspage vs Better Stack vs Instatus?"
- "We're on Statuspage; should we migrate to Better Stack?"
- "Write me an incident communication template"
- "Configure subscriber SMS notifications for our status page"
- "Our incident updates are confusing — audit them"
- "Write a maintenance window announcement"
- "Connect PagerDuty to our status page"
- "We're getting complaints about radio silence during incidents"

Do NOT load for:
- Monitoring/alerting infrastructure configuration → `devops-worker-bee`
- On-call rotation design, PagerDuty/OpsGenie setup → `devops-worker-bee`
- Observability dashboards, SLO/SLI definitions → `devops-worker-bee`
- Operational runbooks → `runbook-writing-worker-bee`

## First action when this stinger is loaded

1. Read `guides/00-platform-selection.md` to understand the 2026 platform landscape — pricing has changed significantly since 2024.
2. Read `guides/10-failure-modes.md` first on every invocation. Covers the three most common status page anti-patterns that erode user trust.
3. Read the appropriate domain guide based on what the user needs.

## Critical directives

These non-negotiables apply on every invocation. Full justification in each guide.

- **Separate the detection layer from the communication layer.** Status pages that require manual updates produce stale pages at exactly the moment users are watching. Always surface the automation integration path. See `guides/05-automation-integration.md`.

- **Never deliver an incident template without a time-box commitment.** The "next update in X minutes" slot is not optional. It is the single highest-impact element in a template. See `guides/02-incident-communication.md`.

- **Cachet v3 is NOT production-ready as of 2026.** Subscriber/notification features are absent from v3.x. Recommend v2.4.1 for production. See `guides/00-platform-selection.md` for the full Cachet decision.

- **Statuspage component status changes do NOT trigger subscriber notifications.** Only incidents do. Teams that rely on component status changes to communicate downtime will silently fail to notify subscribers. Flag this in every Statuspage recommendation.

- **Instatus SMS is BYOC (bring your own carrier).** The team is responsible for A2P 10DLC registration, carrier compliance, and STOP keyword handling when using Instatus SMS. See `guides/03-subscriber-notifications.md`.

- **Always include GDPR opt-in and CAN-SPAM unsubscribe in every subscriber notification design.** These are legal requirements, not best-effort suggestions. See `guides/03-subscriber-notifications.md`.
