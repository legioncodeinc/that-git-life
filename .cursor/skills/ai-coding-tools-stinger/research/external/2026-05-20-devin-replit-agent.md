# Devin 2.0 and Replit Agent: 2026 Autonomous Coding Comparison

## Summary

A 2026 multi-source analysis of Devin 2.0 (Cognition Labs) and Replit Agent as the two dominant fully-autonomous coding tools. Key finding: these are fundamentally different tools solving different problems — Devin works on existing codebases, Replit Agent builds new apps from scratch. Also covers pricing changes in Devin 2.0 (dramatically lowered from $500/month entry to $20/month).

## Key quotations / statistics

- "Devin 2.0 dramatically reduced pricing from $500/month to a $20/month entry tier, shifting positioning from 'replace engineers' to 'tireless junior dev.'"
- "Handles full engineering workflows autonomously: planning, coding, debugging, testing, and deployment"
- "Excels at well-defined, repetitive tasks like code migrations, boilerplate generation, and bug fixes with clear specifications"
- "Achieved 8x efficiency gains for Nubank's code migration across millions of lines"
- "Scored ~14% on early benchmarks for completely solving assigned tasks without human intervention, significantly higher than traditional AI assistants at ~2%"
- "Struggles with ambiguous or architecturally complex work"
- Devin overall rating: 7/10

## Devin 2026 pricing tiers

| Tier | Price | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Core | $20/month | Limited Agent Compute Units |
| Team | $500/month per seat | Parallel sessions, PR automation, API access |
| Additional ACUs | $2.25 each | On-demand compute units |

## Devin vs Replit Agent fundamental distinction

**Devin** — operates on existing codebases, scoped engineering work. Best for handling engineering backlogs, migrations, and repetitive bug fixes. Requires GitHub App integration with write access.

**Replit Agent** — full app-building environment using natural language for creating NEW applications from scratch. Built-in deployment, databases, authentication. Pricing starts at $17/month. Better described as "vibe coding" than "autonomous engineering."

## Annotations for stinger-forge

- `guides/00-tool-tiers.md`: Devin belongs in "fully-autonomous" tier with note on existing-codebase requirement. Replit Agent belongs in "rapid-scaffold" tier or a hybrid "fully-autonomous + scaffold" category since it's cloud-native.
- `guides/01-selection-rubric.md`: The Devin vs Replit axis is "modify existing repo" vs "build new app from scratch" — this is a deterministic branch point in the selection rubric.
- `guides/05-footguns.md`: Devin scope-creep risk — autonomous agents with write access can make wide-ranging changes; the Command Brief directive says NEVER recommend fully-autonomous tools for production repos without flagging this risk.
- The 14% benchmark figure is from early Devin 1.x — stinger-forge should note this predates Devin 2.0 and seek updated SWE-bench scores from the leaderboard source file.
