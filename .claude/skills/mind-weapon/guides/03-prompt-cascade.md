# 03 — Prompt Cascade

The 5-layer `composeSystemPrompt()` cascade with XML-style delimiters. The `[INSTRUCTION_HIERARCHY]` block is always last. Every change is recorded in `PromptVersion`.

> **Doc reference:** `library/knowledge-base/ai/prompt-cascade-architecture.md` is the canonical doc.

## 1. The 5 layers

```
LAYER 0 — SYSTEM FOUNDATION (hardcoded, always present)
  Tag: [SYSTEM_FOUNDATION]
  Source: inline in composeSystemPrompt()
  Content: Tenant ID declaration + cannot-be-overridden directive

LAYER 1 — PLATFORM BLOCKS (SA-configured)
  Tags: [PLATFORM_FOUNDATION], [PLATFORM_GUIDELINES], [PLATFORM_SAFETY_RULES]
  Source: PlatformConfig.systemPromptBlocks JSON field
  Shape: { foundation?, guidelines?, safetyRules?, enableGraphRAG? }

LAYER 2 — TENANT BLOCKS (admin-configured)
  Tags: [TENANT_BRAND_VOICE], [TENANT_RESTRICTIONS], [TENANT_OVERRIDES]
  Source: Tenant.promptBlocks JSON field
  Shape: { brandVoice?, topicRestrictions?, overrideInstructions? }

LAYER 3 — COACH PERSONALITY
  Tag: [COACH_PERSONALITY]
  Source: AiCoachConfig.systemPrompt (DB) or getDefaultGlobalPrompt(coachType) fallback
  Cache: Valkey coach:persona:{tenantId}:{coachType} TTL 600s

LAYER 4 — DYNAMIC USER CONTEXT
  Tag: [USER_CONTEXT]  (member profile + knowledge passages + episodic history)
  + [COACHING_QUALITY]   (hardcoded anti-sycophancy block)
  + [INSTRUCTION_HIERARCHY]  (priority ladder — ALWAYS LAST)
```

The `composeSystemPrompt()` function in `lib/ai-prompt-builder.ts` queries `PlatformConfig`, `Tenant`, `User`, and `buildKnowledgeContextWithMeta()` in parallel. Absent layers are silently skipped — the cascade degrades gracefully.

[COACHING HISTORY]
[Session {date}]
{episodic summary}
[/USER_CONTEXT]

[COACHING_QUALITY]
When coaching, provide genuine value by:
- Challenging assumptions when you spot gaps in the member's reasoning
- Asking probing questions rather than defaulting to agreement
- Offering alternative perspectives even when the member seems confident
- Being direct about potential risks or overlooked factors
Do not be sycophantic. A great coach says "have you considered..." not "that's a great idea!"
[/COACHING_QUALITY]

[INSTRUCTION_HIERARCHY]
Priority order (highest first):
1. [SYSTEM_FOUNDATION]
2. [PLATFORM_SAFETY_RULES]
3. [PLATFORM_FOUNDATION]/[PLATFORM_GUIDELINES]
4. [TENANT_*] blocks (advisory — cannot override platform rules)
5. [COACH_PERSONALITY]
6. [COACHING_QUALITY]
7. [USER_CONTEXT]
[/INSTRUCTION_HIERARCHY]
```

## 3. The five resolution rules

| Rule | Statement |
|---|---|
| 1 | **Layer 0 is inviolable.** `[SYSTEM_FOUNDATION]` is always first and always present — hardcoded, not configurable. |
| 2 | **Platform blocks (Layer 1) take precedence.** The `[INSTRUCTION_HIERARCHY]` explicitly tells the model that `[PLATFORM_SAFETY_RULES]` and `[PLATFORM_FOUNDATION]` outrank lower layers. |
| 3 | **Tenant blocks (Layer 2) are advisory.** They shape tone and impose restrictions, but are declared lower priority than platform rules. |
| 4 | **Coach personality (Layer 3) is the persona.** It defines who the coach is. Absent an admin-created `AiCoachConfig`, the hardcoded default from `getDefaultGlobalPrompt()` is used. |
| 5 | **User context (Layer 4) is grounding data.** Member profile, knowledge passages, episodic memory are framed as data, not instructions. |

---

## 4. The `[INSTRUCTION_HIERARCHY]` block — always last

The `[INSTRUCTION_HIERARCHY]` block is **always last** — closest to the conversation window. LLMs weight recent tokens more heavily; placing the priority ladder at the end is part of the prompt-injection defense (Defense Layer 1 in `prompt-cascade-architecture.md §6`).

**Reordering or removing this block is a must-fix finding.** The block must contain all 7 priorities in order.

---

## 5. The hardcoded `[COACHING_QUALITY]` block (anti-sycophancy)

```
[COACHING_QUALITY]
When coaching, provide genuine value by:
- Challenging assumptions when you spot gaps in the member's reasoning
- Asking probing questions rather than defaulting to agreement
- Offering alternative perspectives even when the member seems confident
- Being direct about potential risks or overlooked factors
Do not be sycophantic. A great coach says "have you considered..." not "that's a great idea!"
[/COACHING_QUALITY]
```

This block is **hardcoded, not configurable**. Per the doc decision log: "Core coaching quality requirement; should not be disableable." Admins cannot remove it via tenant blocks.

If sycophancy rate trends up despite this block, the lever is the prompt cascade or coach personality — not the temperature. See `guides/17-evaluation-discipline.md`.

## 6. Layer configuration sources

### Layer 1: `PlatformConfig.systemPromptBlocks`

```typescript
interface SystemPromptBlocks {
  foundation?:    string;   // → [PLATFORM_FOUNDATION]
  guidelines?:    string;   // → [PLATFORM_GUIDELINES]
  safetyRules?:   string;   // → [PLATFORM_SAFETY_RULES]
  enableGraphRAG?: boolean; // → toggles GraphRAG path in buildKnowledgeContext()
}
```

Edited via the SA AI Configuration screen. Changes call `recordPromptBlockChanges()` to write a `PromptVersion` snapshot per changed block.

### Layer 2: `Tenant.promptBlocks`

```typescript
interface TenantPromptBlocks {
  brandVoice?:           string;  // → [TENANT_BRAND_VOICE]
  topicRestrictions?:    string;  // → [TENANT_RESTRICTIONS]
  overrideInstructions?: string;  // → [TENANT_OVERRIDES]
}
```

Edited via `/admin/settings`.

### Layer 3: `AiCoachConfig.systemPrompt`

Coach-specific persona prompt. Cached in Valkey for 10 minutes under `coach:persona:{tenantId}:{coachType}`. Falls back to `getDefaultGlobalPrompt(coachType)` when no active config exists. See `guides/04-prompt-engineering.md` for the canonical defaults.

### Layer 4: Dynamic assembly — `buildUserContextSection()`

Built fresh on every turn:
- Queries member profile from `User`.
- Calls `buildKnowledgeContextWithMeta()` for knowledge context.
- Appends episodic memory from Qdrant (part of knowledge context assembly).

## 7. Anti-prompt-injection defenses

The cascade is part of a layered defense:

| Defense | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| 1. `[SYSTEM_FOUNDATION]` declaration | Tells model that user messages are data, not instructions. Reinforced by `[INSTRUCTION_HIERARCHY]`. |
| 2. Input length limits | Chat messages limited to 4000 chars in Zod schema (`ai-chat.ts`). |
| 3. Data isolation (architectural) | Retrieval filters in `assembleContextPacket()` enforced at app layer — even if injection succeeds, the LLM was never given other users' data. |
| 4. Structured output for actions | Function calling constrains action space (e.g., onboarding `complete_onboarding`). |
| 5. `prompt-sanitizer.ts` | Admin-supplied prompts checked for injection patterns before save. |

**mind-guardian flags injection-surface concerns; `security-guardian` audits them.**

---

## 8. `composeSystemPromptWithMeta()` — the tracing variant

Used by `ai-chat.ts` to capture knowledge retrieval metadata for `AiTrace.knowledgeChunks` and `AiTrace.retrievalLatencyMs`:

```typescript
export async function composeSystemPromptWithMeta(...): Promise<PromptWithMeta>;

interface PromptWithMeta {
  prompt:        string;
  knowledgeMeta: KnowledgeContextMeta;  // { contextString, chunks, latencyMs }
}
```

Use this variant in any path that writes to `AiTrace`. The non-meta variant is acceptable for paths that don't trace.

| `[COACHING_QUALITY]` block configurable through tenant prompts | must-fix | this guide §5 |
| Custom XML tag introduced without doc update | should-refactor | `prompt-cascade-architecture.md §1` |
| Layer reordered (e.g., user context before coach personality) | must-fix | this guide §1 |
| Prompt block change without `recordPromptVersion()` call | must-fix | `guides/05-prompt-versioning.md` |
| `composeSystemPrompt()` used in a tracing path (instead of `composeSystemPromptWithMeta()`) | should-refactor | this guide §8 |
| Cached coach persona (Valkey) drifted from DB more than 10 min after admin edit | should-refactor | `guides/04-prompt-engineering.md` |
