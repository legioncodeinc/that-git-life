# Source: Headway App

**URL:** https://headwayapp.co  
**Category:** Hosted changelog SaaS with embeddable widget  
**Why it matters:** One of the most widely adopted lightweight changelog widgets; simple integration, clean UI, free tier.

## Feature set (as of 2026)

- **Dedicated changelog page** — public URL (e.g., `yourapp.headwayapp.co` or custom domain on paid plans).
- **Embeddable widget** — small JS snippet; appears as a bell/notification icon with unread count badge.
- **Email subscribers** — users can opt-in to email digests of new entries.
- **Categories/labels** — tag entries (New Feature, Improvement, Bug Fix, etc.) with color coding.
- **Rich text editor** — no-code entry authoring with image support.
- **Changelog RSS feed** — for power users and aggregators.
- **Read receipts** — knows when a logged-in user has seen entries (requires user identifier setup).

## Pricing (2026 approx.)

- **Free tier** — up to 3 seats, 1 project, basic widget.
- **Paid tiers** — start at ~$29/mo for custom domains, multiple projects, advanced widget customization.

## Integration pattern

```html
<!-- Add to <head> -->
<script>
  window.HW_config = {
    selector: "#headway-badge",
    account: "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID"
  }
</script>
<script async src="https://cdn.headwayapp.co/widget.js"></script>
```

## Strengths

- Zero backend; fully hosted.
- Easiest widget integration in the space.
- Free tier covers most indie / small-team use cases.

## Weaknesses

- No native GitHub/Linear integration for auto-drafting entries.
- Limited analytics (no NPS, no user segmentation).
- Custom domain only on paid plan.

## Applicability

- `guides/01-tool-selection.md` — best for: small teams, apps without heavy CRM, speed of setup matters.
- `guides/02-tool-setup.md` — the JS snippet above is the reference integration.
