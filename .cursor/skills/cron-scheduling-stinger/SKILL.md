name: cron-scheduling-stinger
description: Scheduled-job specialist for cron expression authoring, platform-specific limits (Vercel Cron, Cloudflare Cron Triggers, GitHub Actions schedule), distributed-cron correctness (exactly-once execution, leader election, idempotency), timezone and DST safety, retry-on-failure patterns, and the "did the cron run?" observability loop (Healthchecks.io, Cronitor, self-hosted heartbeat tables). Use when the user says "write a cron expression", "set up Vercel Cron", "my cron job runs twice", "GitHub Actions schedule is drifting", "add monitoring for my scheduled job", "cron and DST issue", "distributed cron", or when `cron-scheduling-worker-bee` is invoked.

# cron-scheduling-stinger

Procedural arsenal for `cron-scheduling-worker-bee`, the Legion Army's scheduled-job specialist. This stinger encodes everything needed to design, implement, secure, and monitor scheduled jobs across the platforms a Next.js / TypeScript / Node.js team typically uses.

## When this stinger applies

Load this stinger whenever the work involves:

- Authoring or auditing a cron expression (POSIX, Vercel, Cloudflare, GitHub Actions)
- Diagnosing a job that fires twice (distributed duplication) or never (missed run)
- Setting up monitoring so a missed or failed run pages someone within one schedule period
- Designing a scheduled job to survive DST transitions without skipping or doubling
- Building a retry strategy that doesn't make idempotency mistakes
- Reviewing platform limits before choosing where to host a scheduled job

Do NOT load for:

- Background jobs triggered by queue messages without a time component (no Stinger for this yet — handle inline)
- CI/CD pipeline design (that is `devops-worker-bee`)
- Database schema design for job metadata tables (that is `db-worker-bee`)

---

## First actions when this stinger is loaded

1. Read `guides/00-cron-expression-syntax.md` for the field reference and platform comparison table.
2. Identify the deployment platform (Vercel, Cloudflare, GitHub Actions, POSIX, pg_cron, BullMQ) and read the relevant section of `guides/01-platform-limits.md`.
3. For distributed deployments (>1 replica or region): read `guides/02-distributed-cron-correctness.md` before prescribing any fix.
4. For timezone-sensitive schedules: read `guides/03-timezone-dst-safety.md`.
5. For observability setup: read `guides/05-observability-monitoring.md`.

## Core principles (from Command Brief critical directives)

These are non-negotiable. Each guide in this stinger is structured around them.

- **Never generate a cron expression without explaining it in plain English.** See `guides/00-cron-expression-syntax.md`.
- **Always ask about deployment topology before prescribing a distributed-cron fix.** See `guides/02-distributed-cron-correctness.md`.
- **UTC is the safe default; local timezone must be explicitly justified.** See `guides/03-timezone-dst-safety.md`.
- **Heartbeat monitoring is mandatory for business-critical jobs.** See `guides/05-observability-monitoring.md`.
- **Retry handlers must be idempotent before adding retry logic.** See `guides/04-retry-and-failure-handling.md`.
- **Decouple the trigger from the work for long-running jobs.** If a cron job risks exceeding the platform's execution limit, trigger a queue message and return fast. See `guides/01-platform-limits.md`.

## Platform selection decision tree

```
Does the job need sub-hourly scheduling?
  YES → Use Cloudflare Workers free tier (min: 1 min) or pg_cron/BullMQ
  NO  → Continue

Is it a Next.js / Vercel project?
  YES → Use Vercel Cron (vercel.json). Check plan tier (Hobby = daily only).
  NO  → Continue

Is it a GitHub repo CI task (report generation, stale-issue cleanup)?
  YES → Use GitHub Actions schedule: (min: 5 min, UTC-only, expect drift).
  NO  → Use pg_cron (Postgres-native) or BullMQ repeatable (Node.js/Redis)
```

Full platform comparison: `guides/01-platform-limits.md`.

## Research trail

The `research/` folder was populated by `scripture-historian` at `normal` depth (2025-11-20 to 2026-05-20). Key findings:

- Vercel updated plan limits in January 2026: 100 cron jobs per project on all plans (was 2 on Hobby). Hobby plan still limited to once-per-day minimum frequency.
- GitHub Actions `schedule:` drift is an active January 2026 incident; delays of 22+ minutes observed. GitHub now supports IANA timezone strings in `schedule:` as of early 2026.
- Cloudflare free tier is the canonical workaround for Vercel Hobby users needing sub-hourly schedules.
- `research/research-summary.md` lists 5 open questions for `stinger-forge` — see that file for details.
