## Cross-references

- `guides/13-ecosystem-catalog.md` does not cover notifications — this guide is additive.
- Worker / cron / queue infrastructure that fans out cross-channel notifications is handed off to `devops-worker-bee`.
- Push token storage / rotation / auth posture handed off to `security-worker-bee`.

## Notes

Central framing the guide adds beyond the source doc: notifications are **three different surfaces** (toast / inbox / OS push) that get conflated. Library choice changes by surface:
- Toast: Sonner (default), react-hot-toast (legacy).
- Inbox: Novu (OSS) or Knock (SaaS).
- OS push: OneSignal (managed) or FCM/APNs (direct).

`toast.promise` is highlighted as the canonical "feedback for in-flight action" pattern.
