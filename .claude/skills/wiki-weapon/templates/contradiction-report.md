# Contradiction Report — 2026-04-29

[Append each contradiction below as wiki-guardian detects it during the day. One file per day. Increment `contradiction_count` in frontmatter on each append.]

---

## {HH:MM} — {commit_sha} — {entity-name}

- **Old page:** [[entities/old-version]]
- **New page:** [[entities/new-version]]
- **Reason:** [one-line summary of what changed — signature / return type / side effect / dependency / semantic shift]
- **Commit:** `{sha}` — "{message}" — {author}
- **Severity:** warning | info
- **Resolution suggestion:** [[questions/...]] or "no action needed — informational only"

---

**Severity rubric:**

- **warning** — contract change with potential downstream impact (signature, return type, side effects, dependencies)
- **info** — semantic shift detected but contract preserved (worth surfacing but not alarming)

**File lifecycle:**

- One file per day, named `meta/<YYYY-MM-DD>-contradiction-report.md`.
- wiki-guardian creates from this template on the day's first contradiction; appends thereafter.
- The TS driver may surface a "today's contradictions" widget in the Legion sidebar by reading the most recent dated file in `meta/`.
