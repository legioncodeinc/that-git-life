## Must-fix findings

### M1. `<Short title — e.g., "Webhook handler does not verify Stripe-Signature">`

- **File:** `src/api/stripe/webhook.ts:42`
- **Failure mode:** `<Number from guides/09-common-failure-modes.md, e.g., #4 — raw body broken by JSON middleware>`
- **Citation:** `guides/02-webhook-verification.md §"The contract"`; [Stripe webhook signatures docs](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/signatures); `research/2026-04-25-webhook-signature-verification.md`
- **Impact:** `<money loss / double-charge / missed provisioning / security>`
- **Fix:**

  ```ts
  // Before
  const event = JSON.parse(body); // NO verification

  // After
  const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(rawBody, sig, WHSEC);
  ```

- **Verification:** `<how the team confirms the fix — e.g., stripe trigger checkout.session.completed and observe the request returns 200 with the correct event.id in processed_webhook_events>`

### M2. ...

## Should-refactor findings

### S1. `<title>`

(Optional. Never blocks a PR.)

## Cross-Bee handoffs

`<Findings to surface to other Bees with file:line.>`

- **`security-worker-bee`:** `<e.g., webhook secret stored in plaintext .env committed to repo at infra/dev.env:3>`
- **`db-worker-bee`:** `<e.g., processed_webhook_events table missing or not indexed>`
- **`react-worker-bee`:** `<e.g., publishable key embedded as raw string in src/components/Pricing.tsx:5 instead of env var>`
- **`library-worker-bee`:** `<e.g., no PRD covers what happens on failed dunning at day 21 — needs scoping>`
- **`quality-worker-bee`:** `<post-fix verification needed for items M1, M3, S2>`

---

## What's NOT covered in this audit

- `<e.g., Stripe Connect — out of scope; flag a separate engagement>`
- `<e.g., PCI-DSS attestation paperwork — out of scope; talk to compliance>`
- `<e.g., tax engine selection beyond Stripe Tax — out of scope v1>`

---

## Acceptance checklist (hand to quality-worker-bee)

- [ ] All Must-fix items resolved.
- [ ] Should-refactor items have follow-up tickets.
- [ ] `processed_webhook_events` table exists and is being written to.
- [ ] Webhook handler returns 2xx in < 2 seconds p95.
- [ ] `stripe trigger checkout.session.completed` produces the expected DB state.
- [ ] No `sk_live_*` in repo, CI, or any env file committed to git.
- [ ] `lookup_keys` used everywhere, no hardcoded `price_*`.
