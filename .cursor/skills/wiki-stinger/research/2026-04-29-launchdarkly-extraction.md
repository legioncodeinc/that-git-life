# LaunchDarkly SDK client.variation extraction

## Summary
LaunchDarkly is the largest commercial feature-flag platform, predating OpenFeature. Its SDK uses one canonical evaluation method: `client.variation(flagKey, defaultValue)` — same shape across browser-side `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk`, server-side `launchdarkly-node-server-sdk`, and Node.js client-side. The Node server-side SDK additionally exposes typed methods (`boolVariation`, `stringVariation`, `numberVariation`, `jsonVariation`) which are recommended over the generic `variation`. There's also `variationDetail` returning `{ value, reason, variationIndex }`. Wiki-worker-bee's detection is the same as for OpenFeature in shape: aggregate call sites by flag key.

## Key facts
- Server-side Node SDK methods (recommended typed forms):
  - `client.boolVariation(flagKey, context, defaultValue): Promise<boolean>`
  - `client.stringVariation(flagKey, context, defaultValue): Promise<string>`
  - `client.numberVariation(flagKey, context, defaultValue): Promise<number>`
  - `client.jsonVariation(flagKey, context, defaultValue): Promise<any>`
- Server-side generic: `client.variation(flagKey, context, defaultValue)`. NOTE arg order differs from client-side.
- Client-side (browser/JS) generic: `client.variation(flagKey, defaultValue)`. Synchronous return because flags are bootstrapped at init.
- Detail variants: `variationDetail`, `boolVariationDetail`, `stringVariationDetail`, `numberVariationDetail`, `jsonVariationDetail` — return `LDEvaluationDetail = { value, reason, variationIndex }`.
- Initialization: `LDClient.initialize(envKey, context, options)` (browser) or `LDClient.init(sdkKey, options)` (server). The `client` instance is shared application-wide (singleton convention).
- Lifecycle events: `client.on('initialized')`, `client.on('failed')`, `client.on('ready')`. Important to document because flag evaluations BEFORE `ready` return fallback values.
- Flag bootstrapping (browser): `client.identify(newContext)` switches the active context and triggers a flag refresh.
- `client.allFlags()` returns `LDFlagSet = { [key]: value }` — useful for full-flag audits but rarely seen in app code.
- Bots/CLI in the LaunchDarkly ecosystem (not consumed by wiki-worker-bee, but useful context):
  - `ldcli` lists flags from the LaunchDarkly API — could be a v2 enrichment source.
  - The `find-code-references` integration scans repos for flag-key strings — same idea as wiki-worker-bee's read_at extraction.

## Recommended approach for wiki-worker-bee

Detection heuristic for `feature-flag` (LaunchDarkly variant):

1. **Quick filter:** scan imports for `launchdarkly-js-client-sdk`, `launchdarkly-node-server-sdk`, `launchdarkly-node-client-sdk`, `launchdarkly-react-client-sdk`, or `@launchdarkly/*` org.
2. **AST walk:** find `CallExpression` nodes whose callee text matches:
   - `variation`, `variationDetail`
   - `boolVariation`, `boolVariationDetail`
   - `stringVariation`, `stringVariationDetail`
   - `numberVariation`, `numberVariationDetail`
   - `jsonVariation`, `jsonVariationDetail`
   The callee will typically be `<identifier>.<method>` where `<identifier>` is the LDClient instance.
3. **Extract flagKey:** the first argument that's a string literal.
   - For `variation(flagKey, ...)`: arg[0].
   - For server-side `variation(flagKey, context, defaultValue)`: arg[0] still.
   - The shared rule: the FIRST string-literal argument is always the flag key.
4. **Extract defaultValue:** the LAST positional argument is always the default. This works across browser and server SDK signatures.
5. **Aggregate by flagKey:** one entity page per unique key, same as OpenFeature pattern.
6. **React-specific:** `launchdarkly-react-client-sdk` provides `useFlags()` hook returning the full flag set. When detected, list as `read_at` for ALL keys discovered elsewhere — but the agent can't know which subset is actually used without dataflow analysis. Note this gap in the body.

Entity page differs from OpenFeature only in the `provider: launchdarkly` frontmatter and any LaunchDarkly-specific concepts (variation index, reason codes, percentage rollout context) noted in the body.

For the **dual-provider gotcha** (project uses both OpenFeature AND LaunchDarkly directly): file as one feature-flag entity per flag key, with the body noting both call sites. Frontmatter `provider:` becomes `multi: [openfeature, launchdarkly]`. This case is rare but real for migrating projects.

For projects using LaunchDarkly's `useFlags()` React hook destructuring (`const { myFlag } = useFlags()`), the agent can't easily resolve which keys are read. Recommend: detect `useFlags()` calls and list ALL flag keys from the project as potentially-read (the body can mark "read at scope: <component>"). Better than missing them entirely.

## Quotes worth preserving
> "The variation method determines which variation of a flag LaunchDarkly serves to the current context. variation calls take the feature flag key and a fallback value." — LaunchDarkly docs
> "In the Node.js server-side SDK, there is a variation method for each type, such as boolVariation or stringVariation. These typed methods return a Promise and are recommended over the generic variation method." — LaunchDarkly docs

## Open questions / gaps
- Server-side Node SDK arg order differs from client-side: `(flagKey, context, defaultValue)` vs `(flagKey, defaultValue)`. Wiki-worker-bee's "last positional arg is the default" heuristic handles both, but document this.
- LaunchDarkly's `useFlags()` React hook reads ALL flags, making per-flag `read_at` ambiguous in React projects. Recommend: file `useFlags()` call sites under a `concepts/launchdarkly-react-flag-set.md` concept page, and link individual flag entities to it via `read_at_via: [[concepts/launchdarkly-react-flag-set]]`. Compromise that's better than nothing.
