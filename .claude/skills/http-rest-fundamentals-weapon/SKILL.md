name: http-rest-fundamentals-weapon
description: HTTP and REST protocol authority — audits HTTP method safety/idempotency contracts, status-code honesty, header correctness (Cache-Control, ETag, Vary, CORS), conditional and range requests, HTTP/2 + HTTP/3 readiness, and REST architectural-style compliance. Activate when the user says "audit this API", "is this status code correct?", "why is CORS failing?", "explain preflight", "PUT vs PATCH", "HTTP/3 ready?", or when reviewing any route handler, OpenAPI spec, or HTTP trace. Do NOT activate for TLS/cipher config (devops-guardian), auth token semantics (auth-guardian), or crawler-facing metadata (seo-aeo-guardian).

# http-rest-fundamentals Weapon

Procedural arsenal for `http-rest-fundamentals-guardian`, the HTTP and REST protocol authority in the Legion AI Army.

This weapon encodes the practical reference material needed to audit HTTP and REST usage authoritatively against RFC semantics. It is organized around eight concern areas, each with its own guide, plus templates for common deliverables and worked examples for the most frequently misunderstood scenarios.

**Paired Angel:** `ai-tools/agents/http-rest-fundamentals-guardian.md`
**Command Brief:** `ai-tools/command-briefs/http-rest-fundamentals-guardian-command-brief.md`

---

## First action when this weapon is loaded

Read these in order before doing anything:

1. **`guides/00-principles.md`** -- RFC-first reasoning model; safety vs idempotency; the seven REST constraints; why "RESTful" is usually a lie. This is the foundation every other guide builds on.
2. **`guides/10-failure-modes.md`** (if it exists; otherwise check `reports/README.md`) -- the catalog of common HTTP anti-patterns and their impact classifications.
3. The guide most relevant to the current task (see index below).

Then pick the appropriate template from `templates/` for the deliverable the Angel is producing.

## Critical directives (lifted from Command Brief)

- **Cite the RFC section for every status-code and method ruling.** Why: RFC citations are the only way the developer can verify the ruling and learn the underlying principle.
- **Never conflate HTTP-layer correctness with framework convention.** Why: frameworks sometimes diverge from RFC semantics for DX reasons; the distinction matters for interoperability.
- **Flag CORS wildcard-with-credentials as Critical, not Informational.** Why: this misconfiguration is exploitable by cross-origin attackers.
- **Do not audit authentication tokens, JWTs, or session cookies** -- hand off to `auth-guardian`. Why: boundary prevents duplicate findings.
- **Do not audit TLS, cipher suites, or certificate validity** -- hand off to `devops-guardian`. Why: same boundary rationale; this weapon stays at the application layer.

## Key research signals (from scripture-historian, 2026-05-20)

The following findings from the research sweep are high-signal for this weapon:

- **HTTP/3 split reality:** CDN users (Cloudflare, Fastly, Akamai) get HTTP/3 transparently at the edge. Self-hosted origins must configure QUIC explicitly (nginx 1.25+, Caddy, Envoy). Node.js, Go stdlib, Python stdlib, and Ruby have no first-class HTTP/3 as of 2026.
- **CORS triple-wildcard prohibition:** `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` is forbidden in combination with `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`. The browser throws immediately. The wildcard also applies to `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: *` and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *` -- those too are rejected when credentials are involved in some browsers.
- **RFC 9110 renamed 422:** "Unprocessable Entity" is now officially "Unprocessable Content" per RFC 9110. The status code number is unchanged.
- **RFC 9457 is current for error bodies:** `application/problem+json` format (RFC 9457, superseding RFC 7807) is the standard for structured error responses.
- **Auth-before-CORS gotcha:** OPTIONS preflights arrive without credentials. Any middleware that requires authentication before CORS headers are set will reject preflights with 401, breaking CORS for all non-simple requests.
- **ETag + CDN:** ETags are often stripped or rewritten by CDNs unless explicitly preserved. Audits should check whether ETags survive the CDN layer.
