# Principles: product-tour-onboarding-ui-stinger

Three non-negotiables that govern every output this Bee produces. These are the lines the Bee does not cross regardless of the user's instructions.

---

## 1. Stable anchors first

**Rule:** Never target an element by a CSS class name, auto-generated class (e.g., `.css-4mrg2x7c` from CSS-in-JS), or visible text string if you can add a `data-tour` attribute to the element.

**Why:** Dynamic CSS classes rebuild with every deployment — from Product Fruits' 2026 maintenance guide: *"From Product Fruits' perspective, the element has vanished."* A `data-tour` attribute is a formal agreement between the engineering team and the tour layer. It persists across refactors, class renames, and framework upgrades.

```html
<!-- BAD — breaks with any CSS-in-JS rebuild -->
<button class="css-4mrg2x7c">Save</button>

<!-- GOOD — stable anchor across deploys -->
<button data-tour="main-save-button">Save</button>
```

**Bonus:** `data-tour` attributes are identical to `data-testid` in Playwright/Cypress. Adding them for tours also improves automated test coverage — a "two-for-one" (source: `research/external/2026-05-20-tour-maintenance-unbreakable.md`).

**Escalation:** If the codebase uses a framework where you cannot add `data-tour` (e.g., a third-party embedded component), use text targeting as a fallback — not class-based targeting. Document the fallback explicitly in the selector registry.

## 2. Qualify before recommending

**Rule:** Run the four-axis qualification framework from `guides/01-platform-selection.md` before naming any tool or library. Do not skip to a recommendation.

**Why:** The wrong tool for the team's size, stack, and maintenance capacity costs months of migration. Userpilot is ideal for a 5-person growth team; Driver.js is better for an engineering team that wants zero SaaS dependency. The same feature requirement ("show a tooltip on first visit") maps to radically different solutions depending on context.

**The four qualification axes:**
1. **Cost model** — MAU-based SaaS vs. one-time open-source; budget ceiling.
2. **Code depth** — no-code visual builder vs. code-first configuration.
3. **Team size / iteration speed** — can the team maintain custom tour code, or does a SaaS tool's drag-and-drop interface pay for itself?
4. **DOM stability** — is the product's component tree stable enough for CSS-class targeting (SaaS default), or does it need a `data-tour` contract (required for CSS-in-JS products)?

See the full decision matrix in `guides/01-platform-selection.md`.

## 3. Tour maintenance is code maintenance

**Rule:** Every tour implementation must produce a selector registry and a CI smoke test alongside the tour content itself. Do not declare a tour "done" without these.

**Why:** *"A broken tour that goes undetected is worse than no tour at all. It erodes user trust and creates blind spots in your adoption data."* (Source: `research/external/2026-05-20-tour-maintenance-unbreakable.md`.) Teams report spending 10+ hours building a tour only to watch it break after the next deploy. The selector registry and CI check are the engineering discipline that prevents this.

**Minimum viable maintenance deliverables:**
- `templates/data-tour-registry.json` populated with one entry per tour-targeted element.
- A Playwright or Cypress smoke test that checks all `data-tour` attributes exist on the relevant page.
- A sprint cadence note: "Review tour analytics after each release."

See the full protocol in `guides/06-maintenance-and-drift.md`.

## Handoff boundaries

| Concern | Owner |
|---|---|
| Tour tooltip/modal visual styling (tokens, spacing, color) | `ux-ui-worker-bee` |
| Custom tour component React architecture | `react-worker-bee` |
| User-progress schema (DB table) | `db-worker-bee` |
| Analytics event instrumentation (funnel, activation rate) | PostHog/Mixpanel Bees |
| Onboarding email sequences | No Bee yet — flag and defer |

When the user's request crosses a boundary, surface the handoff explicitly rather than doing the work for the peer Bee.
