# React Version Log

## Deprecated / retired patterns

- Class components (except error boundaries) — functional only.
- `forwardRef` — replaced by ref-as-prop in React 19.
- `defaultProps` on function components — removed in React 19. Use default parameters.
- `propTypes` — rely on TypeScript.
- Moment.js, Enzyme, Recoil, react-scripts (CRA) — all retired.
- Pages Router in new Next.js projects — App Router default.

## How to refresh this log

Re-run the Stinger's research pass every 6-9 months, or sooner when a React major ships. Update this file, then scan each guide for version-anchored claims and refresh as needed.
