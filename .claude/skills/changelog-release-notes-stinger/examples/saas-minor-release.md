## Output (the changelog entry)

```markdown
## [2.4.0] - 2026-05-20

Export your reports, fixed two frustrating bugs, and made the invite email look great in Gmail.

### New
- **CSV export on Reports** — download any report as a CSV from the new export button in the top-right corner of every report view. Supports all date ranges and filter combinations.

### Fixed
- **Blank screen after switching workspaces** — opening a different workspace no longer requires a manual page reload to see the correct data.
- **Invite emails in Gmail** — invitation emails now render correctly in Gmail instead of showing misaligned columns on mobile.

---

**Coming next**
We started work on a bulk action menu for list views but it is not ready for the quality bar we want. Expected in the next release.
```

## What was deliberately omitted

- `Upgrade Postgres connection pool to PgBouncer` — invisible to users. No user behavior changed. Omit.
- `Fix race condition in auth token refresh` — reframed as an observable symptom benefit. But since it is fully internal and users are unlikely to have noticed it as a distinct issue, it was folded into "Fixed" implicitly via the overall stability of the release. If it had caused visible sign-out bugs, it would appear explicitly.

## Notes on the honest scope note

The note is one sentence. It names the feature, says it is not ready, and gives a rough window. It does NOT:
- Give a hard date.
- Apologize.
- Over-explain why.
- Name a ticket number.
