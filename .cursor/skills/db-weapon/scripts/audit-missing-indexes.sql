-- Three audits in one file:
--   1. Foreign keys without an index on the FK column(s).         (must-fix)
--   2. Redundant indexes — (a) is redundant when (a, b) exists.   (should-refactor)
--   3. Apparently-unused indexes — `idx_scan = 0` since stats reset. (should-refactor)
--
-- Run as a superuser or a role with read access to pg_catalog and pg_stat_*.
