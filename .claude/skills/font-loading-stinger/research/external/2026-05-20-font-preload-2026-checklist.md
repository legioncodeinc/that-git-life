# Font Loading Still Causes 23% of LCP Failures: 2026 Optimization Guide

## Summary
2026 data-driven guide reporting that font loading causes 23% of LCP failures.
Provides a 7-item complete optimization checklist for 2026 with specific
production rules. Covers the `fetchpriority="high"` attribute for the primary
body font preload, over-preloading risks, and the recommendation to use CSS
metric overrides (size-adjust + ascent-override) to eliminate font-swap CLS.
Published February 2026.

## Key quotations / statistics

- "Font loading still causes **23% of LCP failures** as of 2026."

- Correct preload markup with `fetchpriority`:
  ```html
  <!-- In <head>, before your stylesheet -->
  <link rel="preload" href="/fonts/inter.woff2"
    as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>
  <!-- For the single most critical font, add fetchpriority -->
  <link rel="preload" href="/fonts/inter-regular.woff2"
    as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin fetchpriority="high">
  ```

- Preload rules (authoritative 2026):
  - Preload **1-2 critical fonts only** (body regular weight)
  - Always include `crossorigin`, even for same-origin fonts
  - Only preload WOFF2 (no TTF or WOFF preloads)
  - Place preload tags **before stylesheets** in `<head>`
  - `fetchpriority="high"` for the single most critical font

- Over-preloading risks:
  - Preloading 3+ fonts competes with LCP images for bandwidth
  - Unused preloads generate console warnings and waste bytes
  - Never preload fonts served via Google Fonts CDN
  - Omitting `crossorigin` causes a double-fetch

- Complete 2026 optimization checklist (7 items):
  1. WOFF2 format for all fonts
  2. Subset to needed character ranges (60-75% size reduction)
  3. `font-display: swap` (or `optional` for LCP-critical hero headings)
  4. Preload the primary body font (1-2 preloads max, with `crossorigin`)
  5. CSS metric overrides for fallback fonts (size-adjust, ascent-override)
  6. Self-host when possible (saves 150-400ms for third-party DNS/TCP/TLS)
  7. Limit total font files to 3-4 maximum

- "For LCP-critical hero headings, consider `optional` to prevent late
  font-swap events from delaying LCP recalculation."

## Annotations for stinger-forge

- This source provides the **authoritative 2026 performance targets** for
  `guides/06-performance-checklist.md`. Use the 7-item list verbatim as the
  checklist structure.
- The `fetchpriority="high"` for the single most critical font is the 2026
  addition to the standard preload pattern — include it in `templates/preload-link.md`.
- The recommendation for `optional` on LCP-critical hero headings resolves a
  nuance not covered by other sources — hero font delay contributes to LCP timing.
- The "150-400ms savings from self-hosting" statistic is useful for
  `guides/04-nextjs-font.md` when explaining why `next/font` self-hosting matters.
- Published February 2026 — highest recency among practitioner sources.
