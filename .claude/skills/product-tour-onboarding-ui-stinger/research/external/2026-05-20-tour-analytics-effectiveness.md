# In-App Guidance ROI: Measuring What Actually Matters (Tandem, May 2026)

## Summary

CFO-ready framework for measuring in-app guidance ROI, published May 6, 2026 by Christophe Barre (co-founder, Tandem). The central argument: tour completion rate is a vanity metric that CFOs do not fund. The metrics that win budget approval are activation rate, time-to-first-value (TTV), and CAC payback improvement. Industry-wide, only 5% of users complete multi-step product tours — yet most teams still report completion rates to their boards. The article provides the full attribution chain: guidance investment → activation event → Day 30 retention → annual renewal. Also covers industry benchmarks by company stage (Series A through C+), step-level completion rate benchmarks by tour length, and the segment NPS method for connecting satisfaction signals to revenue outcomes. Supporting data: Userpilot benchmark covering 547 SaaS companies puts industry average activation rate at 36-37%, meaning 63% of signups never reach first value.

## Key quotations / statistics

- "Tour completion measures whether users clicked 'Next' on a tooltip series, not whether they understood a feature, completed setup, or came back the next day."
- "Only 5% of users complete multi-step product tours industry-wide, yet most teams still report completions to their boards."
- Chameleon 2025 benchmark: 3-step tours → ~72% completion; 7-step tours → ~16% completion.
- "Three-step tours rarely cover the complex configurations that determine whether a B2B user actually activates."
- Industry activation rate (Userpilot, 547 SaaS companies): 36-37% average — "roughly 63% of signups never reach first value."
- Median SaaS trial-to-paid (self-serve PLG): 3-10%. Demo-assisted: 55-75%. "That gap is not a product quality problem, it is an activation problem."
- SaaS Capital research: customer support costs consume 5-8% of SaaS revenue at the median — contextual guidance resolves L2 queries before they become tickets.
- Aircall case study (Tandem customer): "lifted self-serve activation by 20%, enabling complex phone system configurations that previously required human explanation."
- Qonto case study (Tandem customer): "cut time to first value by 40% for 375,000 users" and "guided 100,000+ users to activate paid features, doubling feature activation rates for multi-step workflows."
- Conversion benchmark table:

| Stage | Target activation rate | Target trial-to-paid % | Primary focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| Series A | 30-40% | 10-15% | PQL velocity |
| Series B | 35-45% | 15-20% | Self-serve scale |
| Series C+ | 40%+ | 20-25% | Expansion, feature adoption |

- "Cutting TTV from eight days to under three is not a UX improvement metric, it is a Day 30 retention driver your CFO will recognize as a CAC payback lever."
- ROI formula anchor: CAC payback = CAC / (MRR per customer × gross margin). "If trial-to-paid conversion moves from 10% to 15%, you have added 50% more paying customers from the same acquisition budget without changing CAC."

## Secondary source: PostHog Tour Analytics (posthog.com/docs/product-tours/analytics)

PostHog provides step-by-step drop-off analysis for product tours including:
- Overall completion and dismissal rates at the tour level
- Tour funnel visualization starting from step 1
- Step-level events: shown, completed, selector failures
- Individual step drop-off data to identify which steps block conversion

## Annotations for stinger-forge

- This is the primary source for the "Tour Health Report" measurement section of `templates/tour-audit-report.md`. The activation-rate-first measurement hierarchy should anchor the audit template's "KPI" section.
- The "completion rate is a vanity metric" thesis must be stated plainly in `guides/00-principles.md` (the principles guide) — it reframes the entire stinger's purpose from "build tours that get completed" to "build tours that drive activation."
- The Chameleon benchmark (3-step → 72%, 7-step → 16%) is the quantitative justification for the "3-5 steps max" rule in `guides/05-checklist-activation.md` and should be cited there.
- The attribution chain (guidance → activation event → Day 30 retention → renewal) is the measurement skeleton for `templates/tour-audit-report.md`. Every tour in an audit should be traced through this chain to show whether it contributes.
- The step-level analytics requirement (PostHog tour analytics, Jimo step-level drop-off) reinforces the need for analytics instrumentation at every step, not just at tour start and tour complete. stinger-forge's implementation patterns should include a `onStepShown` and `onStepCompleted` event pattern for both Driver.js and Shepherd.js.
- Contradictions to note: Tandem is a vendor with an AI-first guidance product; some claims about AI agent superiority over traditional tours are marketing-heavy. The benchmarks (Chameleon, Userpilot, SaaS Capital) are from independent sources and can be cited with higher confidence. The Tandem case studies (Aircall, Qonto) are vendor-reported and should be noted as self-reported.
- Open question: the article does not specify how to set up attribution tracking in PostHog or Amplitude specifically (it references them as options). stinger-forge should include a concrete PostHog funnel query example for the tour-to-activation funnel in `templates/tour-audit-report.md`.
