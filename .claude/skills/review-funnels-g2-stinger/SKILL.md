name: review-funnels-g2-stinger
description: Review collection and online-reputation specialist for SaaS products -- G2, Capterra (now G2-owned), Trustpilot, Product Hunt, AppSumo, and Software Advice. Covers platform selection, profile setup, in-product review-request UX (timing, two-step pattern, copy), G2 incentive compliance (2026 rules + FTC Consumer Reviews Rule), Product Hunt launch-day playbook (00:01 PT, first-6-hours intensity, hunter sourcing), negative-review response templates, and earned-badge-as-conversion-asset deployment. Use when the user says "set up G2", "get more reviews", "Product Hunt launch", "is this incentive compliant", "respond to a negative review", "deploy G2 badges", "Capterra strategy", or asks anything about online review platforms for a SaaS product. Do NOT use for SEO structured data (seo-aeo-worker-bee), outbound cold-email infrastructure beyond a review-request drip (cold-outreach-worker-bee), or social amplification of reviews (social-media-marketing-organic-worker-bee).

## Critical 2026 Context

Before reading any guide, internalize these four structural changes that invalidate older advice:

1. **G2 acquired Capterra (February 5, 2026).** G2 now owns Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp. "Diversify across G2 and Capterra" is obsolete -- they are the same company. Strategy must be built around one G2-family account. See `research/external/2026-05-20-g2-capterra-acquisition-consolidation.md`.

2. **G2 badge policy changed (Summer 2025).** Category Leader and High Performer badges now require a paid G2 Marketing Solutions subscription (~$2,999+/year). Free profiles can only display the "Users Love Us" badge (20 reviews, 4.0+ rating minimum). See `research/external/2026-05-20-g2-badges-social-proof-conversion.md`.

3. **FTC Consumer Reviews and Testimonials Rule took effect October 21, 2024.** Conditioning an incentive on positive sentiment is a civil-penalty violation. Disclosure is required for all incentivized reviews. See `research/external/2026-05-20-ftc-endorsement-guidelines-reviews.md`.

4. **AI citation gate.** Review platform presence (G2 rating, Trustpilot score) is now a prerequisite for AI assistant citations (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity product queries). Platform prioritization should factor in AI citation surface area.

## Open questions from research (flag to user if relevant)

These were unresolved after the normal-depth research sweep. If they affect the current advisory:

- **G2 third-party gift card platforms (Sendoso, Reachdesk):** Current policy page does not address explicitly. Recommend manual check at `https://documentation.g2.com/help/docs/understanding-gift-card-eligibility`.
- **Capterra post-acquisition review policy:** Post-February 2026, Capterra's own policy page was not fetched. Treat as G2-equivalent rules until confirmed.
- **AppSumo and Software Advice current listing requirements:** Not fetched; flag before advising on those platforms.
- **Trustpilot paid-plan requirements for invitation collection:** Not fetched; some features (invitation API, bulk invitations) may require a paid Trustpilot plan.
