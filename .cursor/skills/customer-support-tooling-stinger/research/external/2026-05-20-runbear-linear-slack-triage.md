# Runbear + Linear: AI-Assisted Slack-to-Linear Triage (April 2026)

## Summary

Published April 14, 2026. Runbear announced its Linear integration, positioning itself as an "AI brain" between Slack threads and Linear issues. Represents a category of lightweight AI middleware tools that complement (rather than replace) a primary support tool. Relevant to the Bee's integrations guide because it describes the "triage tax" pattern and the automation workflow for support-to-engineering escalation.

**The problem Runbear solves (the "Slack triage tax"):**

Every bug report, feature request, and "quick question" that arrives in Slack requires engineers to: hunt for context, check for duplicates, look up customer value in HubSpot, and manually copy-paste into a new Linear ticket. Estimated at 15 minutes per ticket for unassisted triage.

**Runbear's workflow:**

1. @-mention Runbear in Slack or react with an emoji on a message
2. Runbear drafts a Linear ticket automatically, pulling full thread history
3. Before presenting the draft, Runbear:
   - Searches Linear for duplicate existing issues
   - Pulls customer data from HubSpot (ARR, tier, owner)
   - Summarizes technical details
4. Human reviews draft and clicks confirm
5. When ticket is closed in Linear, Runbear posts back to the original Slack thread

**Sample output format:**
> "I've drafted a ticket. Acme is a $250k ARR customer. Found a similar ticket (LIN-89) about dashboard caching. [Create Ticket]"

**Setup:** Zero-code configuration -- link Linear workspace, map Slack channels to Linear teams, set priority rules.

**Pricing:** Not published in the article; free trial available.

**Competitive context:**

Runbear competes with ClearFeed (Slack+Zendesk/Jira/Linear bridge), Unthread (Slack-native support with Linear sync), and Plain's own native Linear integration. The key differentiation is the AI-enrichment layer (CRM lookup + duplicate detection + customer context) before ticket creation.

## Key takeaways

- The "Slack triage tax" (15 min/ticket manual overhead) is a well-documented pain point at the 10-100 customer scale -- exactly the founder-as-support phase
- Runbear, ClearFeed, and Unthread are the main third-party middleware options for Slack-to-Linear routing (April 2026)
- CRM enrichment (ARR, customer tier) at ticket creation time is a differentiator for B2B support routing
- Bidirectional status sync (Linear close -> Slack notification) eliminates the "is this done yet?" ping loop
- For teams that choose Plain or Pylon as the primary support tool, native Linear integration may make third-party middleware redundant; confirm native integration depth before recommending an add-on
