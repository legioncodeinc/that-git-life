description: Builds production-grade SvelteKit (Svelte 5) + Payload CMS + Supabase websites end-to-end from a brief, applying a 12-phase playbook. Default CMS mode is Payload 3.x (self-hosted Next.js on Vercel, consumed via REST from SvelteKit). Fallback CMS mode is TypeScript-as-CMS for one-page lead-gen sites that skip Payload. Trigger on phrases like "build a website", "scaffold a SvelteKit site", "spin up a marketing site", "build me a lead-gen site", "ship a website from scratch", "create a SvelteKit + Supabase site", or whenever the paired `website-worker-bee` Bee is invoked. Do not trigger for one-off page tweaks, copy edits, or deploy-only tasks.

# Website Stinger

Equips `website-worker-bee` to take a brief and produce a working **SvelteKit (Svelte 5) + Payload CMS + Supabase** monorepo in roughly 45 minutes. The default architecture is:

- `apps/web` — SvelteKit 5 public site (Vercel)
- `apps/cms` — Next.js + Payload 3.x admin + REST API (separate Vercel project)
- Supabase Postgres — dual purpose: Payload's content store (in `payload` schema) + business data (in `public` schema)

The TypeScript-as-CMS fallback (no Payload, no `apps/cms`) is available for one-page lead-gen sites where blog/content management is not required.

This skill is **predominantly autonomous** by design. The Bee batches clarifying questions at the start, then executes phase by phase with smoke checks and commits.

## When to use

- "Build me a marketing site for a B2B product."
- "Scaffold a SvelteKit + Supabase site with a blog."
- "Spin up a one-page lead-capture site."
- "Take this brand kit and ship a site by EOD."

Do not invoke for: one-page copy tweaks, Lighthouse audits on existing sites, deploy-only requests, or pure design exploration.

## CMS mode selection

The inputs round (Step 2) asks: **"Does this site need a managed CMS admin panel with blog/content management?"**

| Answer | Mode | Phases affected |
|---|---|---|
| Yes (default) | **Payload mode** — scaffold `apps/cms`, use Payload Collections for blog/pages, Phase 7 = Payload Admin | Phases 1 (three-app monorepo), 7 (Payload Admin), 9 (Payload blog) |
| No (fallback) | **TypeScript-as-CMS** — no `apps/cms`, blog posts are TypeScript data objects, no admin SPA | Phase 7 skipped, Phase 9 uses static TypeScript data |

Document the choice in the Build Report (Inputs section) and in the Phase 1 commit message.

## Procedure

1. **Read `guides/00-principles.md` first.** It encodes the architectural commitments that downstream phases depend on.
2. **Collect inputs in one batched round.** Use `templates/inputs-checklist.md`. Include the CMS-mode question. Surface architectural consequences of any phase opt-out before scaffolding.
3. **Initialize the Build Report.** Copy `templates/build-report.md` into the target repo as `build-report.md` and fill the Inputs section.
4. **Execute phases in canonical order:** `1 → 2 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 3 → 4 → 8 → 9 → 10 → 12 → 11`. For each phase: read `guides/0N-<topic>.md`, glance at the source PRD in `research/source-prds/`, apply the changes, run the smoke check, update the Build Report row, commit with `feat(phase-N): <name>`.
5. **Skip honestly.** When the brief opts out of a phase, mark it `skip` with a one-line rationale. Never silently downgrade.
6. **Walk Risks and Open Questions** from the source PRDs into the Build Report's Next steps section.
7. **Final pass.** Read the Build Report end to end. Anything that reads as "I forgot why I did that" gets the PRD citation now, not later.

See `guides/13-build-report.md` for the report-authoring discipline.

## Critical directives

- **Always read this SKILL.md and `guides/00-principles.md` before any file write.** Architectural commitments are load-bearing.
- **Never deploy secrets, run destructive SQL on shared Supabase projects, or trigger production builds without explicit user confirmation.**
- **Cite the phase number and the specific PRD section in every commit message and Build Report row.**
- **When a phase's acceptance criterion cannot be met, mark it Skip with a rationale — never fudge.**
- **Honor the canonical reading order (`1 → 2 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 3 → 4 → 8 → 9 → 10 → 12 → 11`).**
- **Never overwrite a non-empty target directory without confirmation.**
- **Surface every Risk (R-N) and Open Question (Q-N) from the source PRDs** in the Build Report's Next steps.

Full rationale lives in `guides/00-principles.md`.

- `examples/example-edge-case-skip-blog.md` — one-page SvelteKit lead-gen site (TypeScript-as-CMS fallback, no Payload)

## Templates

- `templates/build-report.md` — the deliverable shape this skill produces
