# AVIF vs WebP: Which Image Format Should You Use in 2026?

## Key Findings

### Browser Support Comparison (2026)

| Format | Global Coverage | Key Gaps |
|---|---|---|
| WebP | ~97-98% | Nearly universal |
| AVIF | ~93-95% | Older Android, Samsung Internet <14, iOS <16 |

### Compression Comparison

| Format | vs JPEG | vs WebP |
|---|---|---|
| AVIF | 40-60% smaller | 20-30% smaller |
| WebP | 25-35% smaller | baseline |

### Decision Matrix

- **New raster content** (2026): AVIF primary, WebP fallback, JPEG universal fallback
- **Real-time user uploads**: WebP (5-10x faster to encode than AVIF)
- **Legacy enterprise / broad compatibility**: WebP primary, JPEG fallback
- **Maximum compression**: AVIF with build-time encoding

### The Recommended Stack

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image.avif" type="image/avif" />
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp" />
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="..." />
</picture>
```

### CDN Approach (Recommended)

Configure Cloudflare Polish, Cloudinary, or Imgix to serve AVIF automatically based on the browser's `Accept` header — no `<picture>` element needed when your CDN handles format negotiation.

```
Accept: image/avif,image/webp,*/*
```

## Relevance to image-optimization-stinger

Provides the concrete comparison numbers the Command Brief requires ("Cite a specific performance number when recommending format conversions"). The ~40-60% smaller vs JPEG stat is the headline number for AVIF recommendations. Informs `guides/00-principles.md` and `guides/01-format-selection.md`.

## Direct Quotes / Data Points

- "AVIF: Coverage is around 93–95% of global browsers as of early 2026"
- "WebP: effectively 97%+ of global browsers"
- "For most production websites today, AVIF is safe to serve as the primary format with a WebP or JPEG fallback."
- "AVIF encoding is 5-10x slower than WebP, which makes it impractical for real-time user uploads unless you encode asynchronously."
- Browser support table: "WebP: ~94% | AVIF: ~97%" (note: some sources invert these — the consensus is AVIF 93-95%, WebP 97-98%)
