# 18 — Drag-and-Drop & Animation

Source: `research/2026-04-25-dnd-and-animation.md`. Drag-and-drop and motion are the things that make a UI *feel* premium — and the things most likely to break accessibility. This guide picks libraries and enforces the a11y floor.

## TL;DR pick

| Use case | Pick | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Drag-and-drop in React, accessible-first | **dnd-kit** | Modern, headless, replaces react-dnd |
| Cross-framework sortable lists | **SortableJS** | Tiny, framework-agnostic |
| Layout & gesture animation in React | **Motion** (Framer Motion) | The motion standard for React |
| Complex timeline / stagger / SVG animation | **GSAP** | Best-in-class for non-React-y motion |
| Embed designer animations | **Lottie** | After Effects → JSON → web |
| Studio-grade multi-property choreography | **Theatre.js** | Visual editor for code-driven animation |
| Smooth list reorders without DnD | **auto-animate** | Drop-in for `useState` list changes |

The defaults: **dnd-kit** for drag-and-drop, **Motion** for animation, **auto-animate** for "I just want list reorders to feel smooth," and **Lottie** when designers ship After Effects assets.

## When to choose each

### dnd-kit (the React DnD default)
- Replaces `react-dnd`, which is in maintenance.
- Headless: you bring the visual treatment. Plays nicely with Tailwind / shadcn / Radix.
- First-class keyboard support, accessible `aria-grabbed` / `aria-dropeffect` patterns, and live announcements via the `Announcements` API.
- Use for kanban boards, sortable lists, file/tree reordering, drawer/sheet drag handles.

### SortableJS (when React isn't the only client)
- Vanilla JS, framework-agnostic. There's a React wrapper but the library shines outside React.
- Pick it if you're shipping the same DnD UX into a non-React surface (Storybook docs, marketing site, embedded widget).

### Motion / Framer Motion (the React motion default)
- Declarative `<motion.div>` with springs, layout animations, gesture handling, exit animations.
- The library was rebranded **Motion** but the npm package is still `framer-motion`. Same library.
- Use for page transitions, modal in/out, layout-id shared element transitions, draggable elements with snap.

### GSAP (the heavy lifter)
- Use for complex sequences that React's render cycle resists — multi-step timelines, stagger, scroll-driven animation, SVG morphing.
- License changed in 2024: now free for commercial use under MIT-style terms. Verify current license before adopting.
- Best paired with React via `useGSAP` hook (`@gsap/react`).

### Lottie (designer-authored animation)
- After Effects → Bodymovin export → JSON → render in `lottie-react` or `@lottiefiles/dotlottie-react`.
- Use for hero illustrations, success/empty-state animations, onboarding sequences. Don't use for UI motion (use Motion).
- `dotLottie` is the modern format — smaller, animated, supports interactivity.

### Theatre.js (studio-grade choreography)
- Visual editor for code-driven animations — adjust easings/keyframes in a panel, persist as JSON.
- Use for marketing sites, product launches, branded experiences with multi-property choreography.
- Overkill for in-product UI motion.

### auto-animate (the lazy win)
- One-line drop-in: wrap a parent with `useAutoAnimate()` and child additions/removals/reorders animate.
- Use for `useState`-driven lists where DnD isn't needed but reorders should feel less jarring.

## The accessibility floor (non-negotiable)

Drag-and-drop is the single most common source of a11y regressions. The floor:

1. **Keyboard-operable.** Every drag must be doable via keyboard — usually space-to-pick-up, arrows-to-move, space-to-drop, escape-to-cancel. dnd-kit's `KeyboardSensor` handles this.
2. **Live region announcements.** When an item picks up, moves, drops, or cancels, a screen reader hears it. dnd-kit ships an `Announcements` API; provide labels per action (`onDragStart`, `onDragOver`, `onDragEnd`, `onDragCancel`).
3. **`aria-grabbed` is deprecated.** Modern guidance is to manage focus and live region text instead. dnd-kit does this for you. Don't add `aria-grabbed` manually.
4. **Reduced-motion respect.** `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` must disable layout animations and DnD-induced motion. Motion supports this via `useReducedMotion()`. GSAP via `gsap.matchMedia()`.
5. **Touch targets ≥ 44×44 px** for drag handles on touch devices.

If you ship a DnD UI without an `Announcements` provider, that's a **must-fix**.

## Starter (dnd-kit sortable list with announcements)

```tsx
'use client';
import {
  DndContext,
  KeyboardSensor,
  PointerSensor,
  closestCenter,
  useSensor,
  useSensors,
  type DragEndEvent,
} from '@dnd-kit/core';
import {
  SortableContext,
  arrayMove,
  sortableKeyboardCoordinates,
  useSortable,
  verticalListSortingStrategy,
} from '@dnd-kit/sortable';
import { CSS } from '@dnd-kit/utilities';
import { useState } from 'react';

function Item({ id }: { id: string }) {
  const { attributes, listeners, setNodeRef, transform, transition } = useSortable({ id });
  return (
    <li
      ref={setNodeRef}
      style={{ transform: CSS.Transform.toString(transform), transition }}
      {...attributes}
      {...listeners}
    >
      {id}
    </li>
  );
}

export function SortableList() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']);
  const sensors = useSensors(
    useSensor(PointerSensor),
    useSensor(KeyboardSensor, { coordinateGetter: sortableKeyboardCoordinates }),
  );

  return (
    <DndContext
      sensors={sensors}
      collisionDetection={closestCenter}
      accessibility={{
        announcements: {
          onDragStart: ({ active }) => `Picked up ${active.id}.`,
          onDragOver: ({ active, over }) =>
            over ? `${active.id} is over ${over.id}.` : `${active.id} is no longer over a droppable.`,
          onDragEnd: ({ active, over }) =>
            over ? `${active.id} dropped on ${over.id}.` : `${active.id} dropped.`,
          onDragCancel: ({ active }) => `Dropping ${active.id} was cancelled.`,
        },
      }}
      onDragEnd={({ active, over }: DragEndEvent) => {
        if (!over || active.id === over.id) return;
        setItems((cur) => arrayMove(cur, cur.indexOf(String(active.id)), cur.indexOf(String(over.id))));
      }}
    >
      <SortableContext items={items} strategy={verticalListSortingStrategy}>
        <ul>
          {items.map((id) => (
            <Item key={id} id={id} />
          ))}
        </ul>
      </SortableContext>
    </DndContext>
  );
}
```

## Starter (Motion, layout animation with reduced-motion respect)

```tsx
'use client';
import { motion, useReducedMotion } from 'motion/react';

export function FadeUp({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const reduce = useReducedMotion();
  return (
    <motion.div
      initial={reduce ? false : { opacity: 0, y: 12 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
      transition={{ duration: reduce ? 0 : 0.25, ease: 'easeOut' }}
    >
      {children}
    </motion.div>
  );
}
```

## Choice tree

1. **You need drag-and-drop** → dnd-kit (with announcements + keyboard sensor; that's the floor).
2. **You need a sortable in non-React surfaces too** → SortableJS.
3. **You need layout / page / micro-interaction motion in React** → Motion.
4. **You need scroll-driven, timeline, or SVG-heavy motion** → GSAP.
5. **Designer ships an After Effects animation** → Lottie (dotLottie format).
6. **You just want list reorders to feel smooth, no DnD** → auto-animate.
7. **Studio-grade branded experience** → Theatre.js.

## Common findings

> **[Must-fix]** `src/features/board/KanbanBoard.tsx:1` — `react-dnd` in use; no keyboard sensor; no live announcements. Migrate to dnd-kit and provide the `accessibility.announcements` props. See this guide §a11y-floor.

> **[Must-fix]** `src/components/Modal.tsx:5` — Motion fade-and-slide ignores `prefers-reduced-motion`. Wrap with `useReducedMotion`.

> **[Should-refactor]** `src/lottie/welcome.json` — 1.4 MB Lottie file. Re-export as dotLottie or split into smaller animations; cite bundle impact.

## Handoffs

- **Motion tokens (durations, easings, distances) and motion-design intent** → `ux-ui-worker-bee`. Durations and easings live in tokens, not magic numbers.
- **Custom-built interactive canvas / 3D scenes** → React Three Fiber territory; outside this guide.
- **Performance impact of layout animations under load** → `guides/07-performance.md` + Profiler trace.
