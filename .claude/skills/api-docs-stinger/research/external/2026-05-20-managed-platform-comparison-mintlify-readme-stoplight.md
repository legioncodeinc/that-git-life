# Best API Documentation Tools 2026 — APIScout

## Summary

Covers the four platforms that define the developer-facing API docs market in 2026: Mintlify (git-native, MDX, AI, used by Anthropic/Cursor/Coinbase), ReadMe (API metrics dashboard), Stoplight (API design-first, acquired by SmartBear 2023), and Scalar (open-source, no lock-in). Provides decision tree by scenario and pricing table.

## Key quotations / statistics

- "Mintlify is the best choice for developer-facing products where documentation quality is a competitive differentiator."
- "ReadMe is the choice when you need documentation analytics (what endpoints are developers actually hitting from the docs?)"
- "Stoplight is the choice when documentation is the output of your API design process"
- "Scalar is the right choice for teams that want beautiful API reference documentation without vendor lock-in or monthly fees."
- Mintlify: free OSS tier, paid from $150/month
- ReadMe: free basic, paid from $99/month
- Stoplight: free (1 project), paid from $39/month (annual)
- Scalar: self-hosted free (MIT), cloud plans available
- "The selection criterion between these platforms is architectural rather than feature-based."

## Annotations for stinger-forge

- This is the **primary source** for the managed-platform layer in `guides/01-tool-selection.md`.
- The `/llms.txt` support in Mintlify is a forward-looking differentiator — note it in the selection guide.
- Stoplight's SmartBear acquisition (August 2023) and API Hub integration is a longevity risk to flag.
- Scalar's MIT license with zero lock-in is the correct default recommendation for self-hosted setups.
- Pricing data should be verified against live sites before publishing (changes frequently).
