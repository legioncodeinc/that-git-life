=== Reading checklist ===

[ ] Headline node. Top of the tree. Is it Seq Scan, Index Scan, Index Only Scan, Bitmap Heap Scan?

[ ] Rows estimated vs. actual. If off by 10x at any node, statistics are stale or the planner
    is missing context. Run ANALYZE on the affected table.

[ ] Buffer hits and reads. shared hit = cache, shared read = disk. Lots of read on a hot
    query means working set doesn't fit memory or effective_cache_size is wrong.

[ ] Loop counts on Nested Loop nodes. loops=N where N is large = the classic N+1 plan.

[ ] Sort method. external sort = work_mem too small or query is over-sorting.

[ ] Index Scan vs Index Only Scan. If the column is in the SELECT list, an Index Only Scan
    is faster — add an INCLUDE clause to the index to enable it.

[ ] Was the index you expected actually used? If not — wrong column order, wrong type, or
    the planner thinks Seq Scan is cheaper because of skewed statistics.

=== Common diagnoses ===

Seq Scan on >10k rows for a selective predicate     →  Missing or unused index
Estimated rows off by 10x                           →  Stale statistics; ANALYZE
Nested Loop with loops=1000+                        →  Implicit N+1; rewrite as join
external sort ... Disk: 50000kB                     →  work_mem too small
High shared read on a frequent query                →  Working set > memory
Index Scan instead of Index Only Scan               →  Add INCLUDE to the index
