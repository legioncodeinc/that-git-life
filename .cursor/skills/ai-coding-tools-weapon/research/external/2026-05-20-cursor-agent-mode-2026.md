# Cursor vs Windsurf vs GitHub Copilot 2026: Market Positioning and Features

## Summary

A comprehensive 2026 comparison of the three major commercial AI IDEs — Cursor, Windsurf, and GitHub Copilot — by market share, feature depth, and pricing. Cursor dominates with $2B+ ARR; Windsurf pivots under Cognition AI ownership; GitHub Copilot maintains broad enterprise penetration through Microsoft distribution.

## Key quotations / statistics

- "Cursor's $29.3B valuation and $2B+ ARR" — dominant market leader as of 2026
- "Agent Mode with up to 8 parallel Subagents" — Cursor's multi-agent capability
- "Background Agents for autonomous tasks" — Cursor supports fully-autonomous runs without IDE open
- "Proprietary Composer 1.5 model" — Cursor uses a proprietary base model for certain tasks, not just routing to external LLMs
- Both Cursor Pro and Windsurf Pro cost $20/month as of 2026
- GitHub Copilot: $10/month individual, $19/month business; now integrated across all GitHub surfaces

## Cursor 2026 feature highlights

- **Composer**: Multi-file editing agent with natural language orchestration
- **Cursor Tab**: Next-edit prediction (autocomplete evolved into multi-line suggestions)
- **Background Agents**: Run autonomous tasks without keeping the IDE open
- **Agent Mode subagents**: Up to 8 parallel sub-agents for complex tasks
- **Composer 1.5**: Proprietary model layer on top of external LLM routing
- **MCP integration**: Connect external tools and data via Model Context Protocol
- **Rules (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`)**: Project-level AI behavior configuration (defer to `cursor-ide-guardian` for depth)

## GitHub Copilot 2026 status

As of 2026, GitHub Copilot has expanded beyond inline completion:
- Multi-file agent mode (Copilot Workspace)
- PR review suggestions
- Code review integration in GitHub.com
- Free tier for public repos

Still significantly behind Cursor and Windsurf in agentic depth, but benefits from GitHub/Microsoft distribution advantage.

## Annotations for weapon-forge

- `guides/00-tool-tiers.md`: Cursor spans "interactive-pair" (Tab, Composer) AND "hybrid-agent" (Agent Mode, Background Agents) tiers — it's the most feature-complete single tool
- **Scope boundary**: This Weapon owns tool-selection and prompt-discipline for Cursor. Deep Cursor IDE configuration (rules, MCP setup, Cloud Agents SDK) belongs to `cursor-ide-guardian`. weapon-forge must cross-link to that Weapon for Cursor-specific config depth.
- `guides/03-model-routing.md`: Cursor's model routing is more complex than other tools — it uses Composer 1.5 as a proprietary base but routes to external LLMs (Claude, GPT, Gemini) for chat and agent tasks. Document the model picker menu and when to override defaults.
- The Background Agents feature moves Cursor partially into "fully-autonomous" territory — weapon-forge should note this in the tier taxonomy and clarify that Background Agents have the same scope-creep risks as Devin for unattended runs
