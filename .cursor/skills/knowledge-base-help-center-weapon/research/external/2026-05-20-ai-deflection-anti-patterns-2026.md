# AI Customer Support Anti-Patterns: Deflection Mistakes 2026

## Summary

A practitioner guide documenting the most common failure modes when implementing AI-powered KB deflection in 2026. Key anti-patterns include: optimizing for deflection rate alone (ignoring CSAT), losing escalation context when AI hands off to humans, silent regressions when KB content or models are updated, and brand voice degradation under high load. The article also covers RAG-specific failures: hallucinated policies, outdated content causing wrong answers, and insufficient retrieval quality leading to irrelevant citations.

## Key Quotations / Statistics

- "Don't optimize deflection alone — bare deflection kills CSAT when customers aren't actually satisfied"
- "Wire CSAT as a gating constraint from pilot launch"
- "The highest CSAT-impact failure is AI escalating to humans without providing conversation summary, problem statement, and steps already attempted"
- "Model upgrades or knowledge-base changes can degrade real-world performance. Use quarterly evaluation cadence (monthly is standard)"
- "Maintain versioned policy documents and disclaim-and-route on uncertainty to prevent hallucinated policies"
- "Implement reranking to improve chunk relevance beyond vector similarity"
- "Enforce hard rules for refusal when retrieval returns nothing rather than allowing hallucination"

## Five Critical Anti-Patterns

1. **Deflection-only optimization** - Deflection rate alone is a vanity metric; pair with CSAT from day one
2. **Escalation context loss** - When AI hands off to human, it MUST include conversation summary, problem statement, and steps already attempted
3. **Silent regressions** - KB changes or model updates can degrade performance invisibly; establish monthly evaluation cadence minimum
4. **Hallucinated policies** - AI generates policies not in the KB; solution is RAG with hard refusal when retrieval returns nothing
5. **Brand voice degradation** - Under high load, AI responses drift from brand tone; use style guardrails and periodic transcript audits

## KB Structure Requirements for RAG Accuracy

- Use RAG to ground AI answers in actual KB content
- Implement reranking to improve chunk relevance beyond vector similarity
- Enforce hard rules for refusal when retrieval returns nothing
- Maintain versioned policy documents

## Annotations for weapon-forge

- This source is essential for `guides/03-ai-deflection.md` - use the five anti-patterns as a checklist under "What Not to Do" or "Launch Checklist"
- The "escalation context loss" anti-pattern directly supports the Angel's critical directive: "Never configure AI chat-with-docs without a mandatory human-escalation path" - escalation must include context, not just route
- The CSAT gating requirement should be included in the AI deflection setup guide as a mandatory launch step
- The "versioned policy documents" point connects to `guides/04-versioning-multilang.md` - version-drift in KB content causes AI hallucination, not just user confusion
- Monthly evaluation cadence should be included in `guides/05-analytics-content-gap.md` as part of the operational loop
