# Research Plan — devops-weapon

**Angel:** devops-guardian
**Forged:** 2026-04-25
**Topics covered:** `docker` + `depot-actions` from `cursor-subagent-research-combined.md` (sections at lines 282 + 308).

## Open questions from the brief

1. Kubernetes manifests in scope? **Resolved: out of scope.** Cloud-platform Angels and `db-guardian` own runtime topology. devops-guardian stops at "image built and pushed".
2. Hadolint deep config? **Resolved: recommend with default config; don't author custom ruleset.**
3. Pre-Buildx Docker support? **Resolved: out of scope.** Assume Buildx + Docker 24+ as modern default since 2023.
4. Self-hosted runner provisioning? **Resolved: recommend Depot's managed runners; don't author EC2/Terraform for self-hosted runner farms.**

## Inventory checklist (canonical first move on every invocation)

- [ ] `Dockerfile` — base image, stages, USER, HEALTHCHECK, ARG/ENV usage.
- [ ] `.dockerignore` — present? canonical?
- [ ] `docker-compose*.yml` — services, profiles, healthchecks, secrets blocks.
- [ ] `.github/workflows/*.yml` — actions used (and pin form), `permissions:` blocks, OIDC, concurrency.
- [ ] `package.json` — Node version, package manager, scripts.
- [ ] Existing Depot wiring (`uses: depot/...`).
- [ ] Existing scan tooling (Trivy, Scout, Snyk).
- [ ] Existing `Makefile` / `taskfile.yml` / `docker-bake.hcl`.

## Target output

- 7 dated research notes in `research/2026-04-25-<topic>.md` (this file plus 6).
- Source notes for every factual claim in the guides.
- `open-questions.md` if user-judgment calls remain.
