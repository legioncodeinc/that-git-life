# Top 10 App Store Rejection Reasons in 2026 (And How to Avoid Every One) | Forge

## Summary
Definitive list of the ten App Review Guidelines that generate the highest rejection volume in 2026, each mapped to guideline number, cause, and prevention. Published February 2026. Covers: 2.1 (crashes), 4.0 (minimum functionality / web wrapper), 2.3 (accurate metadata), 5.1.1 (privacy label mismatch), 3.1.1 (IAP), 2.5.1 (public APIs / Xcode version), 4.2 (duplicate/template apps), 1.2 (UGC moderation), 5.1.2 (third-party data sharing consent), and 2.3.7 (app preview video accuracy).

## Key quotations / statistics
- Guideline 2.1: "Your app must be fully functional when the reviewer launches it. No crashes, no broken links, no placeholder content, no 'coming soon' screens... This is the single most common rejection reason."
- Guideline 4.0: "Apple expects apps to provide a meaningful, useful experience. If your app is essentially a website wrapped in a WebView, a single-feature calculator... Apple will reject it."
- Guideline 5.1.1: "Your app's privacy practices must match what you declared in your App Store privacy nutrition labels. If your app collects location data but your nutrition label says it does not, that is a rejection."
- Guideline 3.1.1: "If you sell digital content or services within your app, you must use Apple's In-App Purchase system. You cannot direct users to an external website to complete a purchase."
- Guideline 2.5.1: "Your app must only use public APIs, must be built with the current Xcode GM release, and must not include deprecated frameworks."
- Guideline 4.2: "If you submit multiple apps that share the same codebase with only minor cosmetic changes... Apple will reject them. This also applies to template-based apps that are mass-produced."
- Guideline 1.2: "Apple requires content reporting, user blocking, and the ability to filter objectionable material" for UGC apps.

## Annotations for stinger-forge
- Each entry maps to a specific guideline section number — exactly what `guides/03-rejection-playbook.md` needs for citation-ready remediation tables.
- The 3.1.1 entry dovetails with `guides/04-iap-setup.md`: IAP violations are in the top 10, confirming the stinger needs a strong IAP compliance section.
- The 4.0 / 4.2 / 4.3 (minimum functionality / duplicate / spam) cluster deserves its own decision tree: "Is my app a WebView wrapper? Does it duplicate existing apps? Does it generate primarily ads?" These are pre-flight checks.
- Guideline numbers from this source should be cross-referenced with Apple's current published guidelines before stinger-forge cites them — guideline numbering can shift with major reviews.
