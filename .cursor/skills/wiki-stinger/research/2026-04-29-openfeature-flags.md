# OpenFeature flag declaration patterns

## Summary
OpenFeature is the CNCF-graduated vendor-neutral feature-flag spec. Unlike LaunchDarkly, OpenFeature flags are **not declared** in code — they're **evaluated** via SDK methods (`client.getBooleanValue('flag-key', defaultValue, ctx?)`). There is no central declaration; the flag's existence is implicit in its first evaluation. Wiki-worker-bee's `feature-flag` extraction therefore must scan all `client.getXValue('...', ...)` and `client.getXDetails('...', ...)` call sites and aggregate by flag key. The aggregated entity page lists `read_at: [{file, line}, ...]` per the brief — which is exactly the cross-cutting visibility grep doesn't provide.

## Key facts
- Imports: `import { OpenFeature } from '@openfeature/server-sdk'` (server) or `'@openfeature/web-sdk'` (browser).
- Client setup: `const client = OpenFeature.getClient()` after `OpenFeature.setProvider(myProvider)`.
- Four typed evaluation methods (per the spec, REQUIRED by every SDK):
  - `client.getBooleanValue(flagKey, defaultValue, ctx?, opts?): boolean | Promise<boolean>`
  - `client.getStringValue(flagKey, defaultValue, ctx?, opts?): string | Promise<string>`
  - `client.getNumberValue(flagKey, defaultValue, ctx?, opts?): number | Promise<number>`
  - `client.getObjectValue<T>(flagKey, defaultValue, ctx?, opts?): T | Promise<T>`
- Detailed evaluation variants return additional metadata: `getBooleanDetails`, `getStringDetails`, `getNumberDetails`, `getObjectDetails`. Same arg shape; return includes `{ value, reason, variant, errorCode, errorMessage }`.
- Server vs client SDK: server sync return values may be Promises; client SDK is synchronous in browsers because flags are pre-loaded.
- Provider implementations can come from any vendor (LaunchDarkly, Flagsmith, ConfigCat, Split, Unleash). All conform to the same client-facing API — wiki-worker-bee can extract regardless of provider.
- `evaluationContext` is a key/value object used for targeting (user ID, account tier, etc.) — useful for documenting the flag's targeting dependencies but optional.
- Flag default values: the second positional arg is the typed default returned on any evaluation error. This is the agent's best guess at the flag's intended fallback.

## Recommended approach for wiki-worker-bee

Detection heuristic for `feature-flag` (OpenFeature variant):

1. **Quick filter:** import scan for `@openfeature/` packages.
2. **AST walk:** find `CallExpression` nodes whose callee text matches `getBooleanValue | getStringValue | getNumberValue | getObjectValue | getBooleanDetails | getStringDetails | getNumberDetails | getObjectDetails`. The callee will typically be a `PropertyAccessExpression` like `client.getBooleanValue`.
3. **Extract per call:**
   - `flagKey` = first argument (string literal). If not a literal (variable, template, computed), emit `gap` and file under the variable name.
   - `defaultValue` = second argument's text — useful for documenting fallback behavior.
   - `valueType` = method-name suffix (`Boolean | String | Number | Object`).
   - `file:line` = source position.
4. **Aggregate by flagKey:** one entity page per unique flag key. The entity body contains:
   - Type (boolean / string / number / object)
   - Default value
   - `## Read at` subsection: bullet list of `{file:line, default, context}` per call site.
5. **Provider-agnostic by design:** mark the flag with `provider: openfeature` regardless of underlying vendor. If the agent can detect the provider registration (`OpenFeature.setProvider(...)`), record it as `backend_provider: <vendor>` in the body, NOT in frontmatter.

Entity filename: `entities/flag-<sanitized-key>.md`. `entity_type: feature-flag`. Frontmatter includes `read_at: [{file, line}]` array per the brief's recommendation. Note: keep `read_at` as a structured array of objects because YAML supports it cleanly:

```yaml
read_at:
  - { file: "src/billing.ts", line: 42 }
  - { file: "src/checkout.tsx", line: 113 }
```

For string flags with literal default values, include those defaults as a contract hint: "if this flag is missing or evaluation fails, the system behaves as if its value is X."

## Quotes worth preserving
> "The client MUST provide methods for typed flag evaluation, including boolean, numeric, string, and structure, with parameters flag key (string, required), default value (boolean | number | string | structure, required)..." — OpenFeature spec
> "The default value must also be specified. In the case of any error during flag evaluation, the default value will be returned, so give consideration to your default values!" — OpenFeature evaluation API docs

## Open questions / gaps
- For wrapper utilities (`isFeatureEnabled('foo')` that internally calls `getBooleanValue`), AST detection by method name will miss them. Recommend: detect helper-function patterns by tracing imports from a per-repo helper file. Out of v1 scope; emit `gap` for now.
- Should the agent also detect `OpenFeature.setProvider(...)` calls and file the provider as a `service` entity? Recommend yes — provider configuration is architecturally significant. The flag entity links to the provider via `evaluated_by: [[entities/openfeature-provider]]`.
- Hooks (`OpenFeature.addHooks(...)`) — out of v1 scope. Mention as architectural concept if a chunk includes a hook registration.
