# Drift Report — 2026-04-23 (nightly)

**Commit:** abc123def456789
**Branch / PR:** main
**Registry snapshot:** 2026-04-23T02:00:00.000Z
**Generator version:** 0.4.2

## Summary

| Class | Count | Delta vs prior run |
|---|---|---|
| Unregistered | 3 | +2 |
| Orphaned | 1 | 0 |
| Stale | 7 | -2 |
| Mismatched | 2 | +1 |
| Unlinked | 1 | +1 |
| Debt | 4 | 0 |

## Critical (blocks deploy)

- [ ] **Unregistered (feature-bearing)** — `app/src/features/billing/rebilling.ts` declares `@feature billing.rebilling` but no `Feature` row with `key: billing.rebilling` exists. Proposed action: human registers the feature via `guides/assets/01-feature.md`. Owner: `@billing-team`. PRD reference missing.

- [ ] **Orphaned (active)** — `Feature[key=legacy.quest-mode]` — registry row active but no code detected at `codePath: app/src/features/quest-mode/`. Last seen: 2026-02-10. Proposed action: confirm feature was intentionally removed → mark `deprecated` with `sunsetAt: 2026-07-22`.

- [ ] **Unlinked (feature-bearing)** — `Route[key=api.v1.referrals.redeem]` has no `featureKey`. Partner-facing route. Owner needs to assign. Blocks deploy.

## Warnings (fix this week)

- [ ] **Stale** — `Surface[key=pinned-chats-grid]` — file hash mismatch. Generator will re-upsert on next sync run.
- [ ] **Mismatched** — `Page[key=admin-billing-addons]` — human field `planGate: ["pro"]` disagrees with code's `@planGate` annotation `["pro","enterprise"]`. Proposed action: human reviews and reconciles. Generator will not overwrite.
- [ ] **Mismatched** — `ContentEntry[key=legal.tos.version]` — `editableByPlatformAdmin: false` but admin UI shows this as editable. Code audit required.
- [ ] (5 more Stale items — shown in the per-asset breakdown below)

## Informational

- [ ] **Debt** — `FeatureFlag[slug=experimental.old-rollout-2024]` — past `expected_removal_at` (2026-01-15), usage_count=0. Eligible for archive on next human pass.
- [ ] **Debt** — 3 `DesignTokenDefinition` rows deprecated past sunset (180-day window elapsed) with usage_count=0. Eligible for hard delete.
- [ ] **Orphaned (deprecated)** — `Control[key=button-gradient-legacy]` — deprecated since 2025-10. Last seen 2026-02-01. Staying `archived`; will be purge-eligible after 180 days.

## Proposed patches

```sql
-- Deprecation for `legacy.quest-mode`
UPDATE features
  SET status = 'deprecated',
      deprecated_at = now(),
      sunset_at = now() + interval '90 days',
      deprecation_reason = 'Code removed 2026-02-10; confirmed by owner'
  WHERE key = 'legacy.quest-mode';

-- Archive the retired flag
UPDATE feature_flags
  SET retired_at = now()
  WHERE slug = 'experimental.old-rollout-2024' AND retired_at IS NULL;
```

A human must approve before executing any patch. No auto-apply.

## Cross-guardian pings

- `@ux-ui-guardian` — `DesignTokenDefinition[color.legacy-cream]` is past sunset and unused. Please confirm no upcoming brief changes that would revive it.
- `@security-guardian` — `api.v1.referrals.redeem` is partner-facing and currently unlinked. Please include in next partner-contract review.
- `@library-guardian` — `billing.rebilling` has no `prd_ref`. If a PRD exists, please cross-link; if not, a PRD is needed before `active`.
