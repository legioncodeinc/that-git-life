# Sharp vs Jimp vs Squoosh: Image Processing 2026

## Key Findings

- **Sharp**: 9M+ weekly downloads, libvips C library, ~25x faster than Squoosh, supports JPEG/PNG/WebP/AVIF/TIFF/GIF — the production default
- **Squoosh (`@squoosh/lib`)**: Google's WebAssembly codec project, best WebP/AVIF encoding *quality control*, slower throughput
- Next.js internally uses Sharp for `next/image` automatic optimization (AVIF and WebP conversion)
- Sharp AVIF: `quality: 60` looks like JPEG at quality 85 (AVIF is very efficient)
- Sharp AVIF `effort` param: 0-9 scale (higher = slower encoding, smaller file); 6 is a good default

## AVIF Encoding Support Matrix (mid-2026)

| Tool | AVIF Support | Speed | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sharp | Native (libvips/libheif) | Fast | Production runtime & build-time |
| Squoosh CLI (`@squoosh/cli`) | WASM codec | Slow | Build-time batch + quality exploration |
| Squoosh lib (`@squoosh/lib`) | WASM codec | Slow | Programmatic with fine-grained control |
| ImageOptim | Limited (lossless pass) | Fast | CI lossless optimization pass |

## Modern Image Stack in 2026 (from article)

```
1. Accept upload → sharp → generate WebP at quality 85 → store immediately
2. Background job → sharp → generate AVIF at quality 60 → store when complete
3. Generate thumbnail (200x200 JPEG) for lists and grids
4. Serve AVIF to Accept: image/avif browsers, WebP fallback, JPEG universal fallback
```

## Key Sharp Code Patterns

```js
// AVIF conversion
await sharp('photo.jpg')
  .avif({ quality: 60, effort: 6 })
  .toFile('photo.avif');

// WebP conversion
await sharp('photo.jpg').webp({ quality: 80 }).toFile('photo.webp');

// Resize + convert
await sharp('input.jpg')
  .resize(800, 600, { fit: 'cover', position: 'center' })
  .webp({ quality: 85 })
  .toFile('output.webp');

// next.config.js - enable AVIF/WebP
module.exports = {
  images: { formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'] }
};
```

## Relevance to image-optimization-stinger

Answers the Command Brief open question on encoding support matrix. Sharp is the clear production choice; Squoosh CLI for build-time batch optimization of static assets. Directly informs `guides/05-tooling-pipeline.md`.

## Direct Quotes / Data Points

- "Sharp: 9M+ weekly downloads, libvips (C library), 25x faster than squoosh, supports JPEG/PNG/WebP/AVIF/TIFF/GIF"
- "Next.js: Uses sharp for its `next/image` automatic optimization (AVIF and WebP conversion)"
- "AVIF at quality 60 — AVIF is efficient — 60 looks like JPEG 85"
- "Choose sharp for production use cases from the start... use Squoosh CLI for build-time batch optimization of static assets in your deploy pipeline."
