# Five SDK Generators Compared: Speakeasy, Stainless, Fern, APIMatic, and OpenAPI Generator — API Coding

## Summary

Published April 2026. Compares the five most widely deployed SDK generators for OpenAPI specs along criteria enterprises now use for procurement: language coverage, runtime type safety, dependency footprint, OpenAPI fidelity, enterprise features, and deployment flexibility (including air-gapped). Key structural finding: the market divides between generators that treat OpenAPI as source of truth (Speakeasy, APIMatic, openapi-generator) vs those that interpose a proprietary DSL (Stainless, Fern).

## Key quotations / statistics

- "Speakeasy leading on the criteria enterprises weigh most heavily. It supports ten languages, ships TypeScript SDKs with a single runtime dependency using Zod for runtime type validation."
- "Entry pricing [Speakeasy] is $600 per month per language with a free tier covering one language and 250 endpoints."
- "Stainless generates the official SDKs for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cloudflare."
- "Fern was acquired by Postman in January 2026 and supports seven languages. Pricing mirrors Stainless at $250 per month per SDK."
- "OpenAPI Generator covers more than 50 language targets... costs nothing. The practical ceiling is maintenance: the repository carries more than 4,500 open issues."
- "Enterprise adopters typically dedicate three or more full-time engineers to maintaining internal forks [of openapi-generator]."
- APIMatic: oldest commercial entry (since 2014), 7 languages, starts $15/month, no free option. TypeScript SDKs carry 40+ runtime dependencies.

## Generator comparison summary

| Generator | Languages | Free tier | Price | OpenAPI-first? | Key risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Speakeasy | 10 | 1 lang / 250 ep | $600/lang/mo | Yes | Cost at scale |
| Stainless | 7 | No | $250/SDK/mo | No (DSL) | Proprietary DSL; no air-gap |
| Fern | 7 | Yes (OSS) | $250/SDK/mo | No (DSL) | Postman acquisition risk; DSL |
| APIMatic | 7 | No | $15/mo | Yes | 40+ deps; no type safety |
| openapi-generator | 50+ | N/A (free) | Free | Yes | 4,500+ open issues; Java dep |

## Annotations for stinger-forge

- This is the **primary source** for `guides/04-sdk-generation.md`.
- The Fern/Postman acquisition (January 2026) changes the risk profile for Fern — note it prominently.
- Speakeasy's air-gapped CLI suitability is a differentiator for enterprise/regulated environments.
- The "openapi-generator needs a Java runtime" pain point is highly relevant for TypeScript teams — document it.
- For most teams without enterprise budget: recommend openapi-generator for breadth + Fern OSS tier for quality TypeScript/Python output.
- Resolves open question from Command Brief: Fern pricing is $250/SDK/mo after OSS tier — becomes cost-prohibitive vs openapi-generator-cli when generating more than 2-3 languages.
