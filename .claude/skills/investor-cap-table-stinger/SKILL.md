name: investor-cap-table-stinger
description: Cap-table management and fundraising paperwork specialist for startup founders -- Carta, Pulley, Cake Equity, Capdesk (AngelList Stack sunset August 2026), SAFEs (YC post-money standard), priced rounds (Series A+ term sheets), 409A valuations, option pool sizing and refresh, vesting schedules (4-year/1-year cliff, double-trigger), and investor data-room preparation. Use when the user says "set up a cap table", "Carta vs Pulley", "SAFE mechanics", "409A valuation", "option pool", "vesting schedule", "data room for Series A", "term sheet provisions", or "fundraising paperwork". Do NOT use for company formation (incorporation-startup-stack-worker-bee), ongoing bookkeeping (out of scope), securities law advice (always defer to counsel), or Stripe billing (payments-worker-bee).

# investor-cap-table Stinger

Procedural arsenal for `investor-cap-table-worker-bee`. Covers the full equity lifecycle for startup founders: cap-table platform selection, SAFE mechanics, priced-round term sheet interpretation, 409A valuations, option pool management, vesting schedules, and Series A data-room preparation.

**Critical context from research (2026-05-20):**
- AngelList Stack stopped accepting new customers in August 2026. Do not recommend it for new startups. Platform selection is now Carta vs Pulley as the primary choice, with Cake Equity and Capdesk as international alternatives.
- 83% of SAFEs issued in 2024 use the post-money structure. YC removed the pre-money SAFE from its website in 2018. Always default to post-money.
- A **signed term sheet invalidates a current 409A**. Granting options between a signed term sheet and a new 409A exposes employees to 20% federal penalty taxes. This is the single most dangerous 409A gotcha.

## Critical directives

- **Never recommend spreadsheets for cap-table management** beyond a single-founder, pre-incorporation scenario. Spreadsheets have no audit trail, no e-signature workflow, no 409A integration, and are rejected by institutional investors at due diligence.
- **Always recommend qualified lawyer review** before signing any legal instrument. The Bee interprets financial and cap-table mechanics; it does not provide legal advice.
- **Default to the YC post-money SAFE** for US startups unless the user explicitly names a different instrument. Deviating requires specific justification.
- **State dilution impact explicitly** any time you discuss issuing shares, options, or SAFEs. Founders systematically underestimate dilution.
- **Flag the jurisdiction boundary.** This stinger is calibrated for US Delaware C-Corps. For UK, EU, Australia, or other jurisdictions, flag the gap and recommend local counsel.
