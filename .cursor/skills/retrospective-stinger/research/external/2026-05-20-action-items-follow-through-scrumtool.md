# Why Your Retrospectives Are Not Producing Action Items That Stick

## Summary

Published 2026-04-11. ScrumTool's diagnostic post is the most analytically structured source in the sweep for action-item failure modes. It names five specific structural failure modes (not motivation problems) and prescribes four components of a good action item.

**Core thesis:** Action item death is a structural problem, not a motivation problem. Missing one or more structural ingredients makes follow-through optional rather than inevitable.

**Five failure modes:**

1. **No named owner.** "The team will improve our deployment process" assigns the work to everyone — which in practice means no one. When everybody owns something, it is owned by social pressure that evaporates when work gets busy.

2. **No deadline.** Undated action items live permanently on the backlog of intentions. Without a deadline, the item does not exist — it is a wish.

3. **Too large for the sprint.** "Refactor the entire authentication module" is not a sprint-sized action item. When team members see something that would take two weeks, they don't start — they defer.

4. **Invisible — not on the sprint board.** Items that live only in a retro tool or meeting doc are out of sight and out of mind. If the item is not in the sprint backlog somewhere team members actually look, it doesn't have a place in the team's workflow.

5. **No accountability mechanism.** If nothing happens when items are not completed, why complete them? The first five minutes of every retrospective should be a public accounting of last sprint's commitments.

**Four components of a good action item:**
1. A named owner. One person — not "the team," not "engineering."
2. A specific outcome. Not "improve code reviews" but "add a required checklist to the PR template with five items."
3. A deadline within the sprint. If it can't be done in the current sprint: either break it down or remove it.
4. A place in the backlog. A card or ticket in the team's normal tracking system.

**The accountability habit:** Scrum Master opens every retro by pulling up last sprint's action items and reading them aloud, one by one, asking for status. "Done, not done, or carried forward with a reason. Three minutes. No judgment, just accountability."

## Key quotations / statistics

- "This isn't a motivation problem. Engineers aren't lazy or careless. It's a structural problem — action items that don't get done are almost always missing one or more of the ingredients that make follow-through inevitable rather than optional."
- "When everybody owns something, it's owned by the social pressure of the group — and social pressure evaporates when work gets busy."
- "If the action item isn't in the sprint backlog or the team board — somewhere team members actually look — it doesn't exist in a meaningful sense in the team's workflow."
- "Social accountability — knowing that your peers will ask about the thing you committed to — is a far more effective motivator than personal discipline."
- "The structural fix for dead action items isn't discipline — it's removing the friction."

## Annotations for stinger-forge

- This is the primary source for `guides/04-action-items.md`. The five failure modes are the diagnostic checklist the Bee uses when a team has low follow-through rate (ACTION 4).
- The four-component structure (owner, specific outcome, deadline, backlog placement) is the SMART-adjacent framework stinger-forge should encode as the action item template in `templates/action-items.md`.
- "Backlog placement" is a key insight not covered by most SMART frameworks — add it explicitly to `templates/action-items.md`.
- The opening-five-minutes accountability ritual is the canonical implementation of the accountability loop referenced in the Command Brief's ACTION 4.
- Contradictions: This source says deadline "within the sprint"; the Medium post (agile coach) says "the 3-question filter" is more important than SMART. Both are compatible — stinger-forge should present SMART as structure and the 3-question filter as a live facilitation check.
