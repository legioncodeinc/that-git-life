# Build a Next.js MDX Blog in 2026 — Faster Than WordPress, Costs EUR5/Month

## Summary
A 2026 practitioner post demonstrating a complete production MDX blog setup with Next.js using next-mdx-remote for content loading. Covers the cost-competitive case for self-hosted MDX blogs vs headless CMS. Emphasizes the fundamental difference between `next-mdx-remote` and `@next/mdx`: next-mdx-remote is for disk-backed blogs with frontmatter while @next/mdx is for MDX-as-page-routes.

## Key quotations / statistics
- "next-mdx-remote and @next/mdx are fundamentally different tools that solve completely different problems"
- "Use next-mdx-remote for disk-backed blogs with frontmatter; use @next/mdx only when .mdx files function as direct page routes"
- "MDX with self-hosting costs approximately €5/month compared to $300/month headless CMS alternatives"
- "Next.js MDX enables Git-based workflows with PR review, preview deployments, and test coverage in one place"
