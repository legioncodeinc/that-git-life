# Scalar vs Swagger UI vs Redoc 2026 — APIScout

## Summary

Definitive 2026 comparison of the three most common OpenAPI renderers. Scalar (14K GitHub stars, launched 2023) is now the recommended default for new projects because it combines polished documentation with a built-in API client and code generation in a single MIT-licensed package. Redoc (25K stars, ~1M weekly npm downloads) remains the best pure read-only renderer for complex APIs. Swagger UI (~3M weekly downloads) is the most widely deployed but is dated and partially broken on OpenAPI 3.1.

## Key quotations / statistics

- "For new projects starting in 2026, Scalar is the default-best choice."
- "Scalar (14K stars) — fastest-growing API doc tool, combines docs + API client + code generation"
- "Swagger UI — partial support; some 3.1 features render incorrectly or not at all"
- "Scalar is the drop-in Swagger UI replacement — same OpenAPI spec, better UI, zero learning curve"
- Weekly downloads: Scalar ~500K, Redoc ~1M, Swagger UI ~3M
- "Zero lock-in — all three render standard OpenAPI/Swagger documents; switching is just changing the renderer"
