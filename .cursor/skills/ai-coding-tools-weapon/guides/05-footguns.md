## Cline failure modes (HIGH priority — read before recommending Cline)

Five documented failure modes from GitHub issues as of 2026-05-20. Source: `research/external/2026-05-20-cline-footguns.md`.

> **TODO: open question** — Verify which of these failure modes have been resolved in Cline releases after May 2026. The issue report dates span 2025-early 2026.

### 1. Claude Code + Cline tool name clash (Severity: HIGH)

- **Trigger:** Using Claude Code (Anthropic's CLI agent) as the API provider within the Cline VS Code extension simultaneously.
- **Symptom:** "tools: Tool names must be unique" error; Cline becomes non-functional.
- **Root cause:** Both Claude Code and Cline define overlapping tool names; when Cline routes through Claude Code's API, the names clash.
- **Fix:** Set environment variable `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_CONNECT_IDE=false` before starting Cline.
- **Prevention:** Do not use Claude Code as Cline's API provider. Use Anthropic's direct API instead.

### 2. Command execution hang (Severity: MEDIUM)

- **Trigger:** Cline executes GitHub CLI commands (`gh pr create`, `gh pr submit`) that succeed on GitHub's end but produce no terminal response.
- **Symptom:** Cline chat blocks indefinitely; no progress; no error.
- **Fix:** Manually interrupt the Cline task (Ctrl+C), run the gh command manually, then resume.
- **Prevention:** For tasks involving GitHub CLI, prefer Claude Code (better terminal handling) or run gh commands manually before instructing Cline.

### 3. Terminal integration conflict (Severity: LOW)

- **Trigger:** Running Cline alongside VS Code extensions that inject terminal startup commands (e.g., Node version managers, virtual env activators).
- **Symptom:** Multiple startup commands merge into a garbled single-line command; terminal session fails immediately.
- **Fix:** Switch Cline to Background Execution Mode or increase shell integration timeout in VS Code settings.
- **Prevention:** Keep terminal-injecting extensions minimal when using Cline.

### 4. File editing reliability (Severity: HIGH)

- **Trigger:** Large files (>500 lines), files with complex whitespace or mixed line endings, high-frequency edit operations.
- **Symptom:** "Diff Edit Mismatch" errors; infinite retry loops; content truncation.
- **Fix:** Use `write_to_file` (full file replacement) instead of `replace_in_file` (diff-based) for large files. Add to Cline's system prompt.
- **Prevention:** Instruct Cline via system prompt: "Prefer `write_to_file` over `replace_in_file` for files over 500 lines."

### 5. Task history corruption (Severity: MEDIUM)

- **Trigger:** Context windows exceeding 8MB, files with binary content in context, terminal output with ANSI escape sequences.
- **Symptom:** Task history disappears; cannot resume a previously paused task.
- **Fix:** Keep context lean; avoid including binary files; clear ANSI escape sequences from terminal output before including in context.
- **Prevention:** Set a context window warning in the Cline system prompt; periodically archive completed task histories.

## Aider footguns

### Auto-commit without review (Severity: MEDIUM)

Aider auto-commits every accepted change to git by default (`auto-commits: true`). If the developer accepts a change without reviewing the diff, the commit is in the history and harder to undo than a file modification.

- **Fix:** Always review diffs before accepting (`show-diffs: true` in config; this is the default). Set `auto-commits: false` if you prefer to commit manually.
- **Prevention:** Keep `show-diffs: true` and treat Aider's diff view as a mandatory review gate, not a notification.

### Context-loss on large repos (Severity: MEDIUM)

Aider's context is file-based, not semantic. In large repos (>500 files), it may load irrelevant files or miss relevant ones.

- **Fix:** Use `/add <specific-file>` and `/drop <file>` to curate context explicitly per task.
- **Prevention:** Use `read:` in `.aider.conf.yml` only for always-relevant reference files (ARCHITECTURE.md, API contracts). Never add entire directories to `read:`.

## Devin footguns

### Scope creep (Severity: HIGH for production repos)

Devin is a fully-autonomous agent with repo write access. Given an open-ended task, it may make changes across more files and modules than intended.

- **Fix:** Scope tasks as narrowly as possible in the Devin task description. "Add a `deactivate_user` endpoint to `src/users/routes.py`" is better than "Improve user management."
- **Prevention:** Configure Devin's GitHub App with the narrowest repo scope needed. Review every PR Devin opens before merging; do not enable auto-merge.
- **When to escalate:** If the user is considering Devin for a production repo, surface the scope-creep risk explicitly before recommending.

## Bolt.new footguns

### WebContainer hard limits (Severity: HIGH for affected use cases)

Bolt runs entirely in a browser-based WebContainer. Hard limits as of 2026:

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Storage | 300MB |
| RAM | 512MB |
| Native modules | Not supported |
| Docker | Not supported |
| Persistent compute | Not available |

- **Consequence:** Any project requiring native Node modules (`node-gyp`, SQLite3 native bindings, sharp, etc.) will fail silently or with cryptic errors in Bolt.
- **Consequence:** Projects that grow beyond 300MB of dependencies (common in monorepos) will hit storage limits.
- **Fix:** Use Bolt only for web-first prototypes without native dependencies. Migrate to a proper development environment (Cursor, Claude Code, Aider) as soon as native dependencies are needed.

## Cursor footguns

### Cline installed inside Cursor (Severity: LOW-MEDIUM)

Installing Cline as a VS Code extension inside Cursor IDE creates redundant agentic systems that occasionally conflict. Cursor already has Composer/Agent Mode; Cline in Cursor adds a second agent with similar capabilities but different UX.

- **Fix:** Choose one: use Cursor's built-in Agent Mode, or use Cline. Running both in the same Cursor window is not recommended.

## Windsurf footguns

### Ownership uncertainty post-Cognition acquisition (Severity: LOW-MEDIUM for long-term projects)

Windsurf is now owned by Cognition AI (makers of Devin). The product trajectory — whether Windsurf is maintained independently or merged into the Devin platform — was not definitively resolved as of 2026-05-20. Recommending Windsurf as a long-term primary tool for a team carries acquisition-uncertainty risk.

- **Fix:** For short-term or individual use, Windsurf is fine. For long-term team adoption, flag the uncertainty and recommend a backup tool (Cursor, Claude Code) in parallel.
