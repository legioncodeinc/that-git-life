name: preact-stinger
description: Preact 11 specialist skill — signals-based reactivity (v2 API with createModel/useModel), preact/compat migration from React, third-party embed widgets (shadow DOM isolation, IIFE bundles), Astro island integration (client:* directives, >= 5.0.1 useId fix), and Fresh 2.x framework (Deno-native, islands + serializable props). Use when building Preact components, evaluating Preact vs React, migrating from React to Preact, embedding a widget on third-party pages, or working with Astro or Fresh projects. Do NOT use for React architecture in general (react-worker-bee), Next.js App Router configuration (react-worker-bee), or Deno infrastructure beyond Fresh (devops-worker-bee).

# preact-stinger

Procedural arsenal for `preact-worker-bee` — the Legion Army's Preact 11 specialist. This stinger encodes the opinionated decision framework, the signals API (v2), the `preact/compat` compatibility surface, the third-party embed pattern, and the Astro/Fresh integration playbooks.

**First-read priority:** Start with `guides/00-when-to-choose-preact.md`. If you have already classified the scenario, jump to the relevant guide. The research summary is at `research/research-summary.md`.

## When this stinger applies

Load this stinger when any of the following is true:

- The user is evaluating Preact vs React for a new project.
- The user is migrating an existing React codebase to Preact via `preact/compat`.
- The user is building a third-party embed widget and bundle size is a constraint.
- The user is working in an Astro project and wants to use Preact islands.
- The user is working in a Fresh 2.x project.
- The user has Preact code to review, debug, or refactor.
- The user asks about signals (`signal`, `computed`, `effect`, `createModel`).

Do NOT load for:
- Pure React architecture questions → `react-worker-bee`.
- Next.js App Router configuration → `react-worker-bee` (and warn: `preact/compat` + App Router is a footgun).
- Deno DevOps beyond Fresh (deploy configs, Docker, etc.) → `devops-worker-bee`.
- Design system or token decisions → `ux-ui-worker-bee`.

## Scenario classification (read first)

Before applying any guide, classify the incoming request:

| Scenario | Key signal | Primary guide |
|---|---|---|
| New project, evaluating Preact | "should I use Preact?", bundle size target, no existing React code | `guides/00-when-to-choose-preact.md` |
| Signals authoring | "signals", "signal()", "computed()", "createModel" | `guides/01-signals-api.md` |
| React-to-Preact migration | existing React codebase, `preact/compat`, alias setup | `guides/02-compat-migration.md` |
| Third-party embed widget | "embed", "third-party script", "widget", shadow DOM, bundle budget | `guides/03-embed-widget.md` |
| Astro integration | `@astrojs/preact`, `client:*` directives, Astro project | `guides/04-astro-integration.md` |
| Fresh framework | Fresh, Deno, `islands/`, `deno.json` | `guides/05-fresh-framework.md` |

If the scenario is ambiguous, ask one targeted clarifying question before diving into code.

## Critical directives

These are non-negotiables for `preact-worker-bee`. Each has a one-line "why".

- **Never recommend Preact without naming the concrete benefit.** Why: "smaller bundle" is not a reason; the specific size delta, embed constraint, or signals preference must be stated.
- **Always check `preact/compat` compatibility before migrating.** Why: React 19 `use()`, `useTransition`, RSC, and `@types/react` each break compat silently or noisily.
- **`@types/react` must NEVER be installed alongside `preact/compat`.** Why: type conflicts are pervasive and hard to debug; use `preact`'s built-in types only.
- **Next.js App Router + `preact/compat` = footgun. Stop and warn.** Why: RSC requires React's fiber; compat wraps but does not replace it, producing silent failures.
- **Scope signals to the specific use case.** Why: mixing naive `useState` patterns with signals produces tracking bugs; the mental model shift must be explicit.
- **Defer to `react-worker-bee` for React architecture.** Why: the two worker-bees share JSX surface but own different mental models; crossing produces contradictory advice.
