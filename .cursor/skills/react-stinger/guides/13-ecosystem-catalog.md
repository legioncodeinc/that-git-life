# 13 — Ecosystem Catalog

Opinionated picks from awesome-react, filtered to one default per category. When you recommend a library to the user, pick from this table and cite it.

## The catalog

| Category | Default pick | Alt (when) | Don't use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Framework (SSR) | **Next.js 15 App Router** | Remix for loader-centric teams | Gatsby (legacy) |
| Framework (SPA) | **Vite + React Router v7** | TanStack Start for type-first | CRA (retired) |
| Component library (headless) | **Radix UI** | react-aria for maximal a11y | — |
| Design-system starter | **shadcn/ui** | — | Material UI in new design-heavy apps |
| Styling | **Tailwind v4** | CSS Modules / vanilla-extract | styled-components, emotion in new code |
| Icons | **Lucide** | Tabler | react-icons (too heavy) |
| Global UI state | **Zustand** | Jotai (atomic), Redux Toolkit (large teams) | Raw Context for high-velocity |
| Server cache | **TanStack Query** | SWR (small apps) | Redux for server data |
| URL state | **nuqs** | — | Manual `URLSearchParams` |
| Forms | **React Hook Form** | — | Formik (in new code) |
| Validation | **Zod** | Valibot (bundle-sensitive) | Yup (in new code) |
| HTTP | **ky** or **axios** | `fetch` wrapper | raw `fetch` scattered |
| Dates | **date-fns** | Temporal polyfill | Moment.js |
| Charts | **Recharts** | visx (custom) | Chart.js (not React-native) |
| Tables | **TanStack Table** | — | rolling your own |
| Animation | **Framer Motion** | react-spring | — |
| Test runner | **Vitest** | Jest (legacy) | — |
| Component tests | **React Testing Library** | — | Enzyme (abandoned) |
| E2E | **Playwright** | Cypress (legacy) | Selenium |
| API mocking | **MSW** | — | `nock`, manual fetch stubs |
| Auth | **Clerk** / **Auth.js** / **WorkOS** | — | Rolling your own |
| Error tracking | **Sentry** | — | console.error only |
| Bundle analysis | `rollup-plugin-visualizer` (Vite), `@next/bundle-analyzer` | — | — |
| Internationalization | **react-i18next** | FormatJS for complex ICU | — |
| Markdown | **react-markdown** + rehype-sanitize | — | `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` |

## Why each default

- **Next.js 15 App Router** — RSC-native; largest ecosystem for production deployment.
- **Vite + React Router v7** — v7 is React Router's framework-mode release; loaders + actions ported from Remix.
- **Radix UI / shadcn/ui** — a11y first; shadcn gives you the component as code you own.
- **Tailwind v4** — zero runtime, RSC-safe, Oxide engine makes builds fast.
- **Zustand** — smallest API that covers the 90% case.
- **TanStack Query** — full mutation lifecycle, DevTools, invalidation by key pattern.
- **nuqs** — type-safe URL state; adopted by Sentry, Supabase, Vercel, Clerk.
- **React Hook Form + Zod** — performance (uncontrolled inputs) + shared schemas.
- **Vitest** — Vite-native, 5-10x faster than Jest.
- **Playwright** — multi-browser, superior test UI mode.
- **MSW** — service-worker-level mocking; one handler set works in dev, Storybook, tests.
- **Sentry** — React Profiler integration, RSC-aware, source-map upload.

## Deliberately not recommended (explain why)

- **Moment.js** — 70KB+, mutable, maintenance-mode. `date-fns` is ~2KB per function, immutable.
- **Enzyme** — abandoned; tests implementation details. RTL tests user behavior.
- **Recoil** — Meta deprecated. Jotai is the successor in philosophy.
- **styled-components / emotion (new code)** — runtime CSS-in-JS generation is a perf tax and breaks RSC.
- **Redux (without Toolkit)** — boilerplate. RTK is required on Redux.
- **react-scripts / CRA** — retired officially. Use Vite.
- **Material UI (in design-heavy products)** — hard to escape the MD aesthetic. Use Radix + Tailwind when custom branding matters.

## Open question

The Army may want a dedicated **TanStack ecosystem Bee** later (Query + Router + Table + Form + Start). Flagged in `research/research-plan.md` for a future brief.

## Common findings

> **[Should-refactor]** `package.json:18` — `moment` listed; imported in 7 files. Migrate to date-fns. See `guides/13-ecosystem-catalog.md §deliberately-not-recommended`. Batched migration PR recommended.

> **[Should-refactor]** `package.json:23` — uses `enzyme`. Migrate tests to React Testing Library.
