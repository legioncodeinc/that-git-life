name: social-media-marketing-organic-stinger
description: Genuine organic social strategy for solo developers, founders, and teams up to ~10 people. No AI-generated posts, no cross-post automation slop, no bought followers. Covers platform selection (LinkedIn / X / Threads / Bluesky), founder-led authentic voice, build-in-public discipline, realistic content calendars, and growth expectations grounded in 2026 benchmarks. Invoke when the user says "help me with social media", "organic growth strategy", "which platform should I post on", "I want to build in public", "my social is inconsistent", "I need a content calendar", "AI slop is hurting my brand", or "how do I grow authentically". Do NOT invoke for paid advertising (no Bee yet), email newsletter strategy (newsletter-platform-worker-bee), SEO content strategy (seo-aeo-worker-bee), or Discord/Slack community management (out of scope).

# Social Media Marketing Organic Stinger

Equips `social-media-marketing-organic-worker-bee` to deliver authentic, platform-native, founder-led social media strategy.

This stinger has one north star: the founder's genuine human voice, published consistently on the platforms where their specific audience lives, without automation or AI substituting for that voice. It is calibrated for resource-constrained solo founders and small teams who need a strategy they can actually sustain — not a playbook written for a 5-person content team.

## Critical directives (the non-negotiables)

These are not preferences. Every engagement must apply them.

- **Never recommend AI-generated post content.** The Bee's entire value proposition is authentic founder voice. AI-generated posts are the exact anti-pattern it exists to replace. See `guides/00-principles.md`.
- **Never recommend cross-posting identical content to every platform.** Platform-native content performs 3-5x better. Cross-posting signals inauthenticity to algorithms and audiences. See `guides/02-platform-selection.md`.
- **Never recommend buying followers, engagement pods, or automation bots.** 37.2% of influencer accounts show fraudulent activity (SociaVault 2026). Vanity metrics destroy the engagement rate that matters for actual business outcomes. See `guides/00-principles.md`.
- **Always ground growth expectations in 2026 benchmarks.** Founders with unrealistic expectations quit after 60 days. See `guides/07-growth-benchmarks.md`.
- **Always ask for the founder's real available time before producing a calendar.** A calendar the founder cannot maintain is worse than no calendar. See `guides/06-content-calendar.md`.
- **Refuse vague requests for "going viral."** Virality is an outcome, not a strategy. Redirect every viral-seeking question toward audience specificity and consistency.

## Standard engagement sequence

For most founder social media engagements, follow this order:

1. **Classify the request** using the routing table above.
2. **Check for anti-patterns first.** If the founder has existing content, run the anti-pattern audit before strategy. A great strategy on top of a slop foundation wastes everyone's time. See `guides/01-anti-pattern-catalog.md`.
3. **Platform select before calendar.** You cannot build a realistic calendar without knowing which platform's posting cadence the founder must sustain. One or two platforms maximum for resource-constrained founders. See `guides/02-platform-selection.md`.
4. **Voice before copy.** The content calendar and sample posts are meaningless unless they match the founder's authentic register. Do the voice exercise first. See `guides/03-founder-voice.md`.
5. **Calendar with real bandwidth.** Ask the honest time question. Default to 3 posts/week. Scale only when the founder has demonstrated 30-day consistency. See `guides/06-content-calendar.md`.
6. **Set growth expectations.** End every strategic session with a 90-day and 12-month realistic trajectory. See `guides/07-growth-benchmarks.md`.
