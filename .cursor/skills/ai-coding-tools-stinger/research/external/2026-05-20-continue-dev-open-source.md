# Continue.dev: Open Source AI Coding Assistant (2026)

## Summary

Continue is the leading open-source AI code assistant available as extensions for VS Code and JetBrains IDEs. As of 2026 it has 33,028 GitHub stars and 400+ contributors. The tool emphasizes local-first, privacy-preserving deployment with support for any LLM including local models via Ollama. Latest VS Code release v1.3.38 (March 2026) confirms active maintenance.

## Key quotations / statistics

- "33,028 GitHub stars and 400+ contributors" (May 2026 GitHub data)
- "The latest VS Code release is v1.3.38 (March 2026), with the project actively maintained through May 2026"
- "Works offline, allows custom vector databases, and enables teams to continuously finetune custom models using their own development data"
- Licensed under Apache 2.0
- "Supports any LLM including GPT-4, DeepSeek Coder, Claude 2, Code Llama, and Gemini Pro"
- "You can deploy locally (Ollama, LM Studio), in the cloud (vLLM, TGI), or via SaaS providers"

## Core capabilities

- Task and tab autocomplete (generates, refactors, explains code sections)
- Natural language editing (refactor code through instruction prompts)
- File generation (create new scripts and components from scratch)
- Code question answering (ask about highlighted code sections)
- Custom vector database support for private codebase indexing

## Differentiation from paid tools

Continue is the only tool in the comparison set that is fully open source, self-hostable, and works entirely offline. This makes it the default recommendation for:
- Privacy-sensitive environments (enterprise air-gapped networks)
- Teams wanting to bring their own model (BYOM) without vendor lock-in
- Developers preferring JetBrains IDEs (only major open-source option with JetBrains support)
- Local LLM experimenters using Ollama or LM Studio

## Limitations vs Cursor/Cline/Windsurf

- No built-in agentic mode by default (relies on the underlying model's tool-use capabilities)
- UX polish significantly below Cursor or Windsurf
- No proprietary context engine — context quality depends entirely on the user's configuration
- Active development but smaller engineering team than commercial alternatives

## Annotations for stinger-forge

- `guides/00-tool-tiers.md`: Continue belongs in "interactive-pair" tier alongside Cursor but occupies the "privacy-first / self-hosted" sub-category
- `guides/01-selection-rubric.md`: Add a binary branch: "Is the environment air-gapped or privacy-sensitive? → Continue.dev"
- `guides/03-model-routing.md`: Continue's model config is entirely user-controlled; document the `config.json` structure and recommended model assignments (autocomplete model vs chat model)
- The JetBrains support is unique — no other tool in the comparison set has first-class JetBrains support
