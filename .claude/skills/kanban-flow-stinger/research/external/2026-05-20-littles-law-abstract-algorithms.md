# Little's Law: The Secret Formula for System Performance

**Source:** Abstract Algorithms — "Little's Law: The Secret Formula for System Performance"

## Summary

This 2026 article covers Little's Law (L = λW) in depth with both software system application (thread pools, connection pools, CI/CD pipelines) and Kanban/flow management application. It is the most technically thorough recent source found on the law itself, with numeric worked examples and key edge cases.

**The formal statement:**
- L = λ × W
- L = mean number of items in the system (concurrent requests, work items in progress)
- λ = throughput (arrival/departure rate in steady state)
- W = average time an item spends in the system (response time, cycle time)

**The cascade effect (critical for Kanban diagnostics):** When W (cycle time) increases, L (WIP) requirements grow proportionally — even without any new work arriving. "A 5× latency spike at constant traffic can fully saturate a thread pool sized for normal conditions." In Kanban terms: a single slow-moving item can inflate WIP and cascade delays to the entire queue behind it.

**Three rearrangements (each is a diagnostic dial):**
1. L = λW — given throughput and cycle time, find required WIP (capacity check)
2. λ = L / W — given WIP and cycle time, find max throughput ceiling
3. W = L / λ — given WIP and throughput, find implied cycle time (the Kanban diagnostic)

**Real-world application table (from article, directly applicable to Kanban context):**
| System | λ | W | L |
|---|---|---|---|
| CI/CD pipeline | Build jobs per hour | Build duration | Concurrent builds |
| Web server | Requests per second | Response latency | Active threads |
| Kanban board | Items completed per week | Average cycle time | WIP |

**Steady-state requirement:** The law assumes a stable, stationary system. It gives long-term average behavior, not snapshot or individual case predictions. The article recommends a 1.5-2× safety factor for production systems to accommodate tail latency and bursts. In Kanban terms: teams with a significant active expedite load or >20% blocked items are NOT in steady state and should not run L = λW calculations as-is.

**Key sizing formula:** Size resource pools to at least 1.5 × calculated L to handle P99 tail scenarios. The analogy for Kanban: set WIP limits at 1.2-1.5× the throughput-implied WIP to handle bursts without collapse.

## Key quotations / statistics

- "L = λ × W: concurrency = throughput × latency."
- "If latency doubles, required concurrency doubles — even at constant throughput."
- "The law assumes steady state; use a 1.5–2× safety factor for bursty production traffic."
- "A 5× latency spike at constant traffic can fully saturate a thread pool sized for normal conditions."

## Annotations for stinger-forge

- **Critical** for `guides/03-littles-law.md`: the three rearrangements of the formula (each a diagnostic dial) directly maps to the Command Brief's "three-variable dial" instruction. The cascade effect (WIP bloat from slow-moving items) is the key insight for explaining why WIP limits work.
- The steady-state qualification and the 1.5× safety factor are essential for the worker-bee's critical directive: "Apply Little's Law only when the system is in steady state. Flag systems with significant active expedite load, >20% blocked items, or rapidly changing WIP as non-steady-state."
- The real-world application table should be adapted for the `guides/03-littles-law.md` guide — the CI/CD pipeline row directly maps to the Kanban scenario and is a good entry point for developer-audience readers.
- **Cross-reference with stinger neighbor:** the system-capacity application (thread pools, connection pools) is the domain of `devops-worker-bee`. The Kanban flow application is `kanban-flow-worker-bee`'s exclusive territory. Stinger-forge should include an escalation note.
