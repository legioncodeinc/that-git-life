# Timeline, Process, and Expedited Review

*Source: `research/external/2026-05-20-app-store-review-times-2026.md`, `research/external/2026-05-20-eu-dma-app-store-compliance-2026.md`*

## 2026 review time baselines

Apple's historically stated "approximately 24 hours" average is no longer representative for new app submissions. The 104% YoY increase in submission volume in April 2026 has systematically increased baseline times.

| Scenario | 2026 baseline | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| iOS new app (first submission) | 2-5 business days | High |
| iOS app update | 24-72 hours | High |
| iOS critical bug fix (no expedited) | 24-72 hours | Medium |
| Android new app (new publisher) | 3-7 business days | High |
| Android app update (established publisher) | 2-48 hours | High |
| Android new app (new publisher + manual policy review) | 5-14 business days | Medium |

**Release planning rule:** Add 5 business days to your timeline for first submissions, 3 business days for updates.

## iOS: submission workflow

### Before submission

1. **Finalize the build** in Xcode:
   - Archive: `Product > Archive`
   - Validate App: runs local checks before upload
   - Upload to App Store Connect via Xcode Organizer or `altool` / `notarytool`

2. **Complete App Store Connect metadata:**
   - Version information (what's new text)
   - Screenshots for all required device sizes
   - Privacy label (must be complete before submission button is active)
   - Age rating (complete questionnaire)
   - Support URL and marketing URL
   - App Review Information: demo account credentials if app requires login (reviewers will be locked out without these)

3. **Check the App Review Information section** — provide:
   - Contact information
   - Demo account username and password (mandatory if any flow requires login)
   - Notes for the reviewer explaining any non-obvious features
   - Attachment: demo video if the core flow is hard to access

### Submission states

```
Developer uploads build
    │
    └── Waiting for Review    (in queue; 2-5 days for new, 24-72h for updates)
            │
            └── In Review     (reviewer is active; typically 1-4 hours)
                    │
                    ├── Ready for Sale (approved)
                    │
                    └── Rejected    → Resolution Center for response
```

### After rejection: response etiquette

- Reply within 24 hours to maintain your queue position
- Be concise, professional, and specific about what changed
- Attach evidence (video, screenshots) for quality/crash rejections
- Do not argue without evidence; appeals are won on facts, not assertions

## iOS: TestFlight beta review

TestFlight builds also require App Review, but the standard is lower:
- Beta reviews typically complete within 1-2 days
- Beta apps must still comply with most App Review Guidelines
- App Store privacy labels are NOT required for TestFlight-only apps (until App Store submission)
- PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy IS required if the app uses required-reason APIs — this catches many developers by surprise

**Beta groups:**
- Internal testers (up to 100 — Apple ID employees): no review required
- External testers (up to 10,000): requires beta app review before first invitation

---

## iOS: expedited review

Expedited review is a real escalation path, but treat it as a scarce resource.

**Qualifying criteria (Apple's stated criteria):**
- Serious bug fix for a production app that is broken for users
- Legal or regulatory requirement (e.g., court order, regulatory deadline)
- Time-sensitive feature tied to a real-world event (e.g., election result, sports event)

**How to request:**
1. Go to App Review > Contact Us > Request Expedited App Review
2. Fill in: app name, App Store Connect link, version, reason for urgency, impact if delayed
3. Apple's response is typically within 24 hours (approval or denial)

**2026 reality:** Approval rate is down significantly. Research documents ~30% approval rate in 2026 vs ~55% in previous years. Use expedited review only when truly critical. See `research/external/2026-05-20-app-store-review-times-2026.md`.

> **TODO: open question** — The "twice a year" hard limit for expedited review is cited in community sources but not confirmed in Apple's documentation, which says only "extenuating circumstances." Treat expedited review as effectively rate-limited regardless of the exact cap. (See `research/research-summary.md` open question #2.)

## Android: submission workflow

### Before submission

1. **Build the release:**
   ```bash
   # Build signed AAB (recommended over APK for Play Store)
   ./gradlew bundleRelease
   ```

2. **Play Console steps:**
   - Create a new release in the target track (Internal > Closed > Open > Production)
   - Upload the signed AAB
   - Complete release notes for each supported language
   - Complete the data safety form (required before publication)
   - Complete IARC age rating questionnaire

3. **Release tracks:**

| Track | Who sees it | Review required |
|---|---|---|
| Internal testing | Up to 100 specified Google accounts | No review |
| Closed testing (alpha/beta) | Specified groups up to 20,000 | Minimal automated review |
| Open testing | Public opt-in beta | Automated + policy review |
| Production | All Play Store users | Full review |

### Play Store review: what triggers manual review

Google Play applies automated scanning to all releases. A human reviewer is assigned when:
- New app from a publisher with <3 apps
- App requests sensitive permissions (location, contacts, camera, microphone in combination)
- Data safety form declares significant data collection
- The app's target country list includes markets with special compliance requirements

## EU DMA compliance (iOS, EU only)

The EU Digital Markets Act required Apple to open iOS distribution in the EU. Key 2026 state:

- **Alternative marketplace apps** are available in the EU but adoption is low
- **Alternative payment providers:** EU apps under Apple's Alternative Terms Addendum can offer third-party payment options for digital goods
- **"No mix & match" rule:** Apps using Apple's Alternative Terms cannot offer both App Store IAP and an alternative PSP on the same storefront. The exact definition of "storefront" (per-country vs per-platform) has not been fully clarified.

> **TODO: open question** — The EU DMA "no mix & match" storefront scope definition is not definitively clarified in Apple's public documentation as of research date. Until this is clarified, assume "per country" scope — i.e., if you offer an alternative PSP in Germany (EU), you must also remove App Store IAP in Germany. (See `research/research-summary.md` open question #1.)

For apps NOT using the Alternative Terms, behavior is unchanged. The EU App Store operates with the same submission process as all other regions.

## App lifecycle update cadence

After launch, maintain submission hygiene:

- **Annual target API level update (Android):** Required each year or updates are blocked
- **Privacy label update:** Required within 30 days whenever data collection changes
- **ASO refresh:** Every 30 days for live apps (see `guides/01-aso-strategy.md`)
- **SDK audit:** After any dependency update that adds a new third-party SDK, re-audit the PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy and data safety form
