name: legal-docs-stinger
description: SaaS legal document generation and maintenance specialist. Covers Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, DPA, MSA, and Cookie Notice using the template+lawyer-review path. Anchored in Termly/Iubenda generators and GDPR/CCPA/Quebec Law 25/LGPD compliance postures. Use when the user says "generate a privacy policy", "draft a DPA", "set up our Terms of Service", "review a customer DPA redline", "which legal doc generator should I use", "GDPR compliance for SaaS", or when legal-docs-worker-bee is invoked. Do NOT use for technical data-protection controls (security-worker-bee), database schema for personal-data fields (db-worker-bee), or contract negotiation strategy beyond the DPA (legal team).

## The attorney-review invariant

Every output from this stinger is a **best-effort starting point**, not a compliance certification. The canonical closing line for all outputs is:

> "This is a generated draft for reference. Have a qualified attorney licensed in your jurisdiction review all legal documents before publishing or countersigning."

No exceptions. Including this line is a critical directive for `legal-docs-worker-bee`.

## Refresh triggers

Re-run scripture-historian at `shallow` tier when any of the following occur:

- New EU SCCs version published by the European Commission
- CCPA/CPRA implementing regulations amended
- Quebec Law 25 enforcement action or new CAI guidance
- LGPD (ANPD) material enforcement action or new guidance
- New IAB TCF major version
- EU-US DPF adequacy decision challenged or revoked (Schrems III risk)
- A new data category or sub-processor added to the product (partial refresh)
- Termly or Iubenda pricing / jurisdiction-coverage changes materially
