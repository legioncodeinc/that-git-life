# payments-stinger — replay-webhook-locally.sh
#
# Replays a Stripe event against your local webhook handler. Two modes:
#   1. Re-fire a SPECIFIC event ID (good for debugging a real production failure
#      against a local fixed handler).
#   2. Trigger a fresh fixture event of a given type.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Stripe CLI installed and `stripe login` completed.
#   - `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook` running in
#     another terminal (or a substitute URL passed as $LISTEN_URL).
#   - The local app running and serving the webhook route.
#
# Usage:
#   ./replay-webhook-locally.sh resend evt_1AbC123XYZ
#   ./replay-webhook-locally.sh trigger checkout.session.completed
#   ./replay-webhook-locally.sh trigger customer.subscription.updated
#
# See: guides/06-testing-and-cli.md, guides/09-common-failure-modes.md.
