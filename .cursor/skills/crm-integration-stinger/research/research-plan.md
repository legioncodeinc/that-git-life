## Research tools used

- Perplexity MCP (`perplexity_search`) for 4 expansion queries
- Results: ~100 source pages reviewed across 9 queries
- 10 highest-value sources filed as annotated external notes
- Raw search results preserved in agent-tools cache files at `C:\Users\mario\.cursor\projects\c-Users-mario-GitHub-legion-code\agent-tools\`

## Coverage verdict

Normal-tier depth achieved and exceeded. All 5 primary query domains returned substantive, non-repetitive 2025-2026 material. Four additional expansion queries added official-docs coverage for HubSpot (rate limits + webhook HMAC), Attio (v2 API limits), Salesforce (data model taxonomy), and the secondary CRM platforms (Pipedrive, Close, Folk, Copper).
