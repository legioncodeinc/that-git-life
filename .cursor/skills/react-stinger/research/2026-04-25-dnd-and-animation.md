## Cross-references

- `guides/13-ecosystem-catalog.md` already lists Framer Motion as the animation default. This guide expands to dnd-kit / SortableJS / GSAP / Lottie / Theatre.js / auto-animate and codifies the a11y floor.
- Motion tokens (durations, easings, distances) are owned by `ux-ui-worker-bee` — explicitly handed off.

## Notes

The guide's central new contribution beyond the source doc is the **a11y floor for DnD**: keyboard sensor, Announcements provider, deprecated `aria-grabbed`, reduced-motion respect, and 44×44 touch targets. These are non-negotiable because DnD is the most common a11y-regression source in product UIs.

No new web_search_exa expansions performed.
